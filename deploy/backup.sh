# Dump the GSTBot database, prove the dump is readable, and prune what has
# aged out. Run by gstbot-backup.timer; safe to run by hand:
#
#   systemctl start gstbot-backup.service        # exactly what the timer does
#   sudo -u gstbot /opt/GSTBot/deploy/backup.sh  # same, without the sandbox
#
# The database holds tax documents with a statutory retention period, so the
# thing this guards against is not only disk failure — it is a bad migration
# or a mistaken delete, which a snapshot of the volume taken afterwards would
# happily preserve.
#
# Two limits worth knowing rather than discovering:
#
#   * The dumps land on the same disk as the database. That covers operator
#     error and corruption; it does not cover losing the box. Copying $DEST
#     off-host is a separate job and is not done yet.
#   * /var/lib/gstbot/invoices holds the uploaded originals and is not dumped
#     here. A restore gives back every row, including the paths of files that
#     are no longer there.
#
# Postgres is shared with the other products on this box. This dumps one
# database, by name, as the one role that owns it — never `pg_dumpall`, which
# would put Herald's and HomeNex's data in a file owned by GSTBot's service
# account.
