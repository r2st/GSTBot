# Release GSTBot on the Hetzner box. Run as root:
#
#   /opt/GSTBot/deploy/deploy.sh              # release the tree that is in /opt
#   /opt/GSTBot/deploy/deploy.sh v1.2.0       # deploy a tag or sha, needs a remote
#
# First-time server setup is in deploy/README.md; this script assumes it has
# already been done and does nothing that is only correct once.
#
# **origin/main is the default source, and the tree is the fallback.** A
# read-only deploy key now lives on the box and is pinned in the checkout's
# core.sshCommand, so the no-argument release fetches and checks out
# origin/main. Before that key existed `git fetch` answered 401, an earlier
# version of this script fetched unconditionally and so could not release at
# all, and the fallback below — ship whatever rsync left in $ROOT — was the
# ordinary path. It is still the path on any box with no credential, which is
# why it stays; it is no longer the expected one here.
#
# The fallback is quiet enough to be dangerous, so it announces itself: a
# release that could not reach the remote says why, because a broken key and a
# box that never had one look identical from the outside and the first one
# ships stale code under a green release.
#
# Unlike a blue/green release, this builds in place: the checkout and the build
# output are the live ones. The box is shared with three other products and has
# roughly 2 GB of headroom, so keeping N releases of node_modules on disk and a
# second copy of the tree costs more than the seconds of downtime it removes.
# While the frontend rebuilds, gstbot-web keeps serving the previous dist from
# the open file handles it already has; the swap is the restart at the end.

# makes this check report the edge's steady state rather than its blind spot.
