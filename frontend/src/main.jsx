// Two boundaries, deliberately. This outer one is the last resort — it catches
// a crash in the Shell or the auth provider itself, where the inner per-page
// boundary has already been unmounted. Inside the router, because it resets on
// navigation and needs useLocation.
//
// PageTitleProvider sits outside that boundary rather than in: it owns the live
// region that announces route changes, and the one navigation most worth
// announcing is the one away from a screen that has just crashed.
//
// StateCodesProvider is above the router so its one fetch survives navigation
// between invoices, and inside the boundary because it holds no state worth
// keeping across a crash. It requests nothing until a screen asks it to.
