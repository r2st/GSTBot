/**
 * What every screen shows while it is waiting.
 *
 * Three of the pages have a loading assertion in their own file and six do
 * not, which is the shape this kind of coverage always ends up in: whoever
 * wrote the page that jumped when its data landed added the test, and the rest
 * were never asked. A placeholder is easy to leave off and invisible when it is
 * missing — the page simply renders empty for 300ms and then fills in, which
 * nobody notices locally and everybody notices on a phone connection.
 *
 * So this is the sweep rather than nine separate assertions: every route is
 * mounted against a server that has not answered yet, and each is required to
 * be showing a placeholder that says what it is loading. A page that lands
 * without one fails here rather than in a bug report about the screen
 * flickering.
 *
 * The requirement is a *labelled* one. `Skeleton.jsx` puts the label in a
 * visually hidden span inside an `aria-live` region precisely so that waiting
 * is announced rather than being a silent gap, and a bar with no label is a
 * decoration that leaves a screen reader with nothing to say.
