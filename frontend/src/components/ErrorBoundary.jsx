/**
 * Catches render-time crashes so one bad field does not blank the whole app.
 *
 * A class because there is still no hook equivalent of componentDidCatch. Note
 * what this does *not* catch: rejected promises, event handlers, anything
 * async. Those are the API errors, and the pages already surface them through
 * ErrorBanner. What lands here is the other kind — a shape from the server that
 * the render did not expect, e.g. a null where a nested total was assumed.
 * Without a boundary that is a white screen, and the user has no idea whether
 * their upload saved.
 *
 * The fallback is a prop rather than fixed markup because the boundary is used
 * at two scales. Around a route, taking over the content area is right. Around
 * a single widget it is not: a chart that cannot draw should cost the chart,
 * not the four stat cards and the tax table sitting above it.

 * What a caught error is allowed to put on screen, introduced as such.

 * The text is whatever the render threw, which means it is a programmer's
 * sentence: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'total')". Nowhere else
 * does this product show one — the backend answers a bug with an opaque
 * apology and a correlation id, and `tests/test_error_prose.py` holds every
 * refusal it makes to a bar this line could not pass.
 *
 * It stays anyway, because the alternative is worse here than it is there. A
 * render crash reaches no log a human will look at: there is no request behind
 * it, no correlation id to trade for the real error, and the browser console
 * is not a place users go. Removing the line would leave whoever is told about
 * the crash with nothing but "a screen broke", which is not a bug report.
 *
 * So it is labelled rather than removed. Unlabelled, raw exception text under
 * an apology reads as the *explanation* — the app's answer to what went wrong,
 * addressed to a reader it will not make sense to. Named as a thing to quote,
 * the same string stops being an explanation and becomes the one use the
 * reader can actually put it to.
