 * one of these is fixed by opening the invoice — a GSTIN retyped, a missing
 * number filled in. An issue raised against the period rather than a row (an
 * unreadable extraction, say) has no id and so no link.
 *
 * `field` arrives as the model attribute name. Underscores stripped is the
 * whole translation: "counterparty gstin" is what the column is about, and a
 * lookup table mapping each field to prose would be one more place to forget
 * to add a field.
