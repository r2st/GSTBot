  //
  // The client drops the dead token; without this the session in React outlived
  // it. `Protected` kept rendering because `user` was still set, every request
  // after that went out unauthenticated and failed the same way, and `/login`
  // bounced straight back to `/` — which is gated on `user`, not on the token.
  // The one screen that could fix it was the one screen unreachable. Clearing
  // the user here is what turns an expired token into a redirect to sign in.

  // its own validity: `setActiveBusinessId` survives in localStorage across
  // sessions, while the membership behind it can be revoked, or the business
  // deactivated, at any time from the other side. `/auth/me` resolves through
  // `get_current_business`, so a selection that is no longer granted answers 403
  // — and treating that like any other failed session check signs the user out
  // of an account that is perfectly fine, on a browser that then does it again
  // on every reload, because the selection causing it is never cleared. Drop the
  // selection and ask once more as the login's own tenant, which is the tenant
  // they would have been switched back to anyway.

   * point the whole app at a business the backend may refuse — and the refusal
   * arrives per page, as each one fails on its own, rather than here where
   * there is something to say about it. So: select, ask `/auth/me` who that
   * makes us, and put the previous selection back if the answer is no.
   *
   * `user.business.id` is what the rest of the app keys off afterwards, because
   * it is the tenant the server says the request acted for, rather than the
   * tenant this browser last asked for.

  // linked business is enforced against that membership's role. An owner
  // linked into a client as a viewer has `role: "owner"` and
  // `active_role: "viewer"`, and gating on the former would show a full set of
  // buttons for the one business where every one of them is refused.
  //
  // Derived from the server's answer rather than tracked separately, so it
  // changes with the business the moment `/auth/me` says it has — see
  // `switchBusiness`, which sets `user` from that response.
  //
  // This hides controls; it does not enforce anything. `require_writer` on the
  // route is the enforcement, and it stays the only thing standing between a
  // viewer and a write — a client can always call the API directly. What this
  // buys is that a viewer is not invited to try.
