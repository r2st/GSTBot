/**
 * The banner every page puts its errors in, and the button on it nothing pressed.
 *
 * Seven pages render `<ErrorBanner … onDismiss={() => setError("")} />` and
 * the coverage report named all seven the same way: the handler was the only
 * function in the file no test ever called. That is the shape a dismissal gap
 * always has — the banner's *appearance* is what a page test is written about,
 * because that is the behaviour someone was fixing, and the × beside it is
 * added in the same commit and asserted in none.
 *
 * What it costs to leave alone is not the coverage figure. This banner is
 * `role="alert"`, so it is announced the moment it appears and it stays on
 * screen until something clears it; a dismissal that did not work would leave
 * a stale sentence sitting above a page that has since recovered, and the
 * banner is exactly where a user looks to find out whether it has. So the
 * sweep is over the route table rather than one page: a screen that lands
 * without a working × fails here rather than in a report about an error
 * message that would not go away.
 *
 * The dismissal is required to clear the *banner* and nothing else. Every one
 * of these pages says a second thing underneath — an empty panel, a skeleton
 * that never filled, a table with no rows — and those describe a period that
 * still has no data. Clearing them with the banner would turn "we could not
 * find out" into "there is nothing here", which is the one reading a user
 * acts on differently.
 *
 * One banner in the app deliberately has no ×, and it is asserted here as
 * such rather than left out: the invoice screen renders a second, undismissable
 * one for the case where the invoice never arrived, because there the sentence
 * is the whole page. See the second describe block.
