 * `SecurityError` or `QuotaExceededError` on access rather than answering null
 * — and this module was reading it bare. `AuthProvider` calls `getToken()`
 * synchronously in an effect, so the throw landed in the outer ErrorBoundary:
 * the whole app became the crash screen, on every reload, with no way through
 * it. A compliance app that cannot be signed into by someone whose IT has
 * locked the browser down is worse than one whose session ends with the tab.
 *
 * So this degrades the way the backend degrades when Redis is gone — falls back
 * in-process, never fails the operation. The cost is precisely stated: the
 * session lives for the life of the tab and does not survive a reload. Signing
 * in, switching business, and every request in between still work.
 *
 * Guarded per call rather than probed once at import, because the two failures
 * are not the same shape: blocked site data throws on the first read forever,
 * while a quota fills up mid-session and throws on a write while reads keep
