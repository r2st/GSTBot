/**
 * A viewer's whole session, page by page, against a server that means it.
 *
 * The per-page tests each mount one screen with `StubAuth role="viewer"` and
 * check that its controls are gone. That is the right question asked eleven
 * times, and it leaves two it cannot ask. The first is whether a viewer can
 * still *use* the product — a page hidden rather than made read-only passes
 * every "the button is absent" assertion while being a wall. The second is
 * whether hiding is all that stands there: `canWrite` decides what renders,
 * `require_writer` decides what happens, and a screen tested only against a
 * client-side flag would look identical whether or not the server agreed.
 *
 * So this walks the app as a viewer over the same fake server the lifecycle
 * flow uses, with the role set on the server as well as in the session: every
 * read answers, every write refuses 403, and the tour is checked for having
 * sent no write at all. The role comes from `/auth/me` rather than from a stub,
 * so `active_role` is doing the work it does in the browser.
