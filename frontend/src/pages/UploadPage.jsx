          `uploadFiles` reads the type once, at the top, and the loop under it
          is deliberately sequential — so a batch is uploaded under the type it
          was started with, and forty invoices take minutes to get through.
          Left live, the radio moved while the loop went on sending the old
          value: the screen said Sales and the remaining thirty files were still
          being booked as purchases.

          Which is the direction that costs money. A sales invoice booked as a
          purchase claims input credit on the business's own output tax — an
          over-claim with interest and a penalty on it — and nothing downstream
          re-reads the document to catch it, because every screen shows the type
          that was stored.

          Disabled rather than made to take effect mid-batch: splitting one drop
          across two types by how fast the user clicked is not a thing anyone
