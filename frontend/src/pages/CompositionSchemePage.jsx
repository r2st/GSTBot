            </p>

              Yes, service providers with aggregate turnover up to ₹50 lakh can opt for the
              Composition Scheme under Section 10(2A). They pay GST at 6% (3% CGST + 3% SGST)
              on their turnover.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the restrictions under Composition Scheme?</h3>

              Composition dealers cannot collect GST from customers, cannot claim Input Tax
              Credit, cannot make interstate outward supplies, and must file CMP-08 quarterly
              and GSTR-4 annually instead of regular returns.
            </p>

            <h3>Who cannot opt for the Composition Scheme?</h3>
            <p>
              Manufacturers of ice cream, pan masala, and tobacco products; businesses making
              interstate supplies; e-commerce operators and suppliers through e-commerce
