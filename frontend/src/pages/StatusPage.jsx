/**
 * What the two ops probes mean for the person reading them.
 *
 * `/health` and `/health/jobs` report dependencies and heartbeats, which is
 * the right shape for a monitor and the wrong one for a business. Nobody
 * running a trading company needs to know that a Celery broadcast ping went
 * unanswered; they need to know that the invoices they uploaded this morning
 * are not being read, and that the deadline alerts they rely on are not being
 * raised. So every row here is captioned by its consequence, with the raw
 * finding underneath it for whoever is actually debugging.
 *
 * The probes are public and untenanted — deliberately, because an operator
 * watching the queue has no token to send — so nothing on this page is scoped
 * to a business and nothing on it leaks one.
