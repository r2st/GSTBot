        <h2>What is the Composition Scheme Under GST?</h2>
        <p>
          The Composition Scheme under GST (Section 10 of the CGST Act) is a simplified tax
          compliance option for small businesses. Instead of filing monthly returns and charging
          GST on each invoice, composition taxpayers pay tax at a flat rate on their turnover and
          file returns quarterly. It is designed to reduce the compliance burden for micro and
          small enterprises.

        <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          Not every business can opt for the Composition Scheme. The key eligibility conditions are:

          <li>Service providers can opt in if turnover does not exceed <strong>₹50 lakhs</strong></li>
          <li>Must not be engaged in inter-state outward supplies (sales outside your state)</li>

        <h2>Tax Rates Under the Composition Scheme</h2>
        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Category</th>
              <th>CGST Rate</th>
              <th>SGST Rate</th>
              <th>Total Rate</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Manufacturers (other than excluded goods)</td>
              <td>0.5%</td>

              <td>1% of turnover</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Restaurants (not serving alcohol)</td>
              <td>2.5%</td>
              <td>2.5%</td>
              <td>5% of turnover</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          These rates are applied on the total turnover — not on individual invoices. The tax is
          paid out of the taxpayer's margin, since composition dealers cannot charge GST to their
          customers.

        <h2>Benefits of the Composition Scheme</h2>
        <ul className="blog-checklist">
          <li><strong>Lower tax rates:</strong> 1-6% compared to standard GST rates of 5-40%</li>
          <li><strong>Simplified compliance:</strong> file CMP-08 quarterly and GSTR-4 annually, instead of monthly GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced record-keeping:</strong> no need to maintain detailed invoice-level records for GST purposes</li>
          <li><strong>Lower working capital requirements:</strong> the lower tax rate means less cash locked up in tax payments</li>
          <li><strong>No e-invoicing requirement:</strong> composition dealers are exempt from the e-invoice mandate</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Restrictions and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          The Composition Scheme comes with significant trade-offs that businesses must consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Input Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> you cannot claim ITC on purchases — the tax paid on inputs is a cost</li>
          <li><strong>No inter-state supply:</strong> you can only sell within your state; inter-state sales disqualify you</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot collect GST:</strong> invoices must state "composition taxable person, not eligible to collect tax on supplies"</li>
          <li><strong>No e-commerce sales:</strong> you cannot sell through platforms like Amazon or Flipkart</li>
          <li><strong>Bill of supply:</strong> you must issue a bill of supply instead of a tax invoice</li>
          <li><strong>Limited to B2C:</strong> since you cannot issue tax invoices, B2B customers cannot claim ITC on purchases from you</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Filing Requirements</h2>
        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Return</th>
              <th>Frequency</th>
              <th>Due Date</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>CMP-08</td>
              <td>Quarterly</td>
              <td>18th of the month following the quarter</td>
              <td>Self-assessed tax payment statement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>GSTR-4</td>
              <td>Annual</td>
              <td>30th April of the following financial year</td>
              <td>Annual return with turnover and tax details</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          This means just 5 filings per year (4 quarterly CMP-08 + 1 annual GSTR-4), compared to
          at least 25 for regular taxpayers (12 GSTR-1 + 12 GSTR-3B + 1 GSTR-9).

        <h2>When to Choose the Composition Scheme</h2>
        <p>
          The Composition Scheme is ideal when:
        </p>
        <ul className="blog-checklist">
          <li>Your customers are mostly end consumers (B2C) who do not need ITC</li>
          <li>Your input purchases have low GST components (raw materials at 5% or nil-rated)</li>
          <li>You operate within a single state with no plans for inter-state expansion</li>
          <li>You want to minimise compliance effort and costs</li>
          <li>Your turnover is well within the limits and unlikely to cross them mid-year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is <strong>not</strong> ideal when your customers are businesses that need ITC, when
          you have significant input tax to recover, or when you plan to sell across state borders.
