        <p>
          HSN codes (Harmonized System of Nomenclature) are the backbone of GST classification in India.
          Every product you sell, manufacture, or trade needs a correct HSN code to determine the
          applicable GST rate. With over 21 sections and 5,000+ codes, finding the right one can be
          challenging. This guide explains the HSN system, lists the major code categories with GST rates,
          and shows you how to find the exact code for your products.
        </p>

          Use our <Link to="/hsn-sac-finder">HSN/SAC Finder</Link> to instantly search and find the
          correct code for any product or service.

      <section>
        <h2>What Is the HSN Code System?</h2>
        <p>
          The Harmonized System of Nomenclature was developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO)
          in 1988 for classifying goods traded internationally. Over 200 countries use this system.
          In India, HSN codes are used under GST to classify goods for tax purposes. The system uses
          a hierarchical structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2-digit code:</strong> Chapter — broad category (e.g., 01 = Live animals)</li>
          <li><strong>4-digit code:</strong> Heading — more specific group (e.g., 0101 = Horses, donkeys)</li>
          <li><strong>6-digit code:</strong> Subheading — internationally standard (e.g., 010121 = Pure-bred horses)</li>
          <li><strong>8-digit code:</strong> India-specific tariff item (e.g., 01012100 = Pure-bred breeding horses)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Similarly, services are classified using SAC (Services Accounting Codes) — 6-digit codes
          starting with &quot;99&quot;. For example, 998311 = Management consulting services.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>HSN Code Requirements on Invoices</h2>
        <p>
          The number of HSN digits required depends on your annual turnover:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Turnover up to ₹5 crore:</strong> 4-digit HSN code on B2B invoices (optional on B2C)</li>
          <li><strong>Turnover above ₹5 crore:</strong> 6-digit HSN code on all invoices (B2B and B2C)</li>
          <li><strong>For GSTR-1 filing:</strong> 6-digit HSN codes are mandatory for all taxpayers in HSN Summary</li>
          <li><strong>For E-invoicing:</strong> 4-digit minimum; 6-digit recommended</li>
          <li><strong>For E-Way Bills:</strong> 4-digit minimum for goods movement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Find the Correct HSN Code</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify your product category:</strong> Start with the broad section (e.g., textiles, machinery, food)</li>
          <li><strong>Narrow to the chapter:</strong> Each section has chapters — find the 2-digit chapter code</li>
          <li><strong>Find the heading:</strong> Within the chapter, find the 4-digit heading that best describes your product</li>
          <li><strong>Get the subheading:</strong> Extend to 6 digits for the specific product variant</li>
          <li><strong>India-specific tariff:</strong> If needed, use the 8-digit code from the Customs Tariff</li>
          <li><strong>Verify the GST rate:</strong> Cross-check the rate notification for your HSN code</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common HSN Classification Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Using generic codes:</strong> Applying a chapter-level (2-digit) code when a specific heading is available</li>
          <li><strong>Classifying by end use:</strong> HSN classifies by nature and material, not always by end use. A cotton garment is textile (Chapter 61/62), not fashion</li>
          <li><strong>Mixing HSN and SAC:</strong> If you supply both goods and services, use HSN for goods and SAC for services on the same invoice</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring amendments:</strong> GST Council periodically reclassifies items — stay updated with <Link to="/blog">our blog</Link></li>
          <li><strong>Wrong rate bracket:</strong> The same product can have different rates based on value (e.g., garments above/below ₹1,000)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HSN Code Changes Under GST 2.0</h2>
        <p>
          With the upcoming GST 2.0 reforms, the classification system is expected to undergo changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rate rationalization:</strong> The 4-slab structure (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) may be simplified to 3 slabs</li>
          <li><strong>Reclassification:</strong> Several items may move between rate brackets</li>
          <li><strong>Cess changes:</strong> Compensation cess may be reformed or replaced</li>
          <li><strong>8-digit mandatory:</strong> Proposals to make 8-digit HSN codes mandatory for larger businesses</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How many digits of HSN code are mandatory?</h3>
        <p>
          Businesses with turnover up to ₹5 crore need 4-digit HSN codes on B2B invoices. Above ₹5 crore,
          6-digit codes are mandatory on all invoices. For GSTR-1 filing, 6-digit codes are required for
          the HSN Summary section regardless of turnover.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the difference between HSN and SAC codes?</h3>
        <p>
          HSN codes classify goods and have 4–8 digits (e.g., 8517 for telephones). SAC codes classify
          services and have 6 digits starting with 99 (e.g., 998311 for management consulting). Both
          determine the applicable GST rate.
        </p>

        <h3>Where can I find the HSN code for my product?</h3>
        <p>
          Search on the CBIC website, the GST portal&apos;s HSN search tool, or use our free{" "}
          <Link to="/hsn-sac-finder">HSN/SAC Finder</Link>. You can also check your supplier&apos;s
          invoices or customs import documents for the HSN code.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I use the wrong HSN code?</h3>
        <p>
          Wrong HSN codes can lead to incorrect tax rates, ITC mismatches between buyer and seller,
          show-cause notices from the tax department, and penalties during audits. If you discover an
          error, file an amendment in the next return period.
        </p>

        <h3>Are HSN codes the same worldwide?</h3>
        <p>
          The first 6 digits are internationally standardized by the World Customs Organization (WCO)
          and used by 200+ countries. India adds 2 more digits for domestic classification, making
          it an 8-digit tariff code. The international portion helps in import/export classification.
