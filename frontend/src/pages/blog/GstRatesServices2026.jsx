      <h1>GST Rates for Services 2026 — Complete Rate List with SAC Codes</h1>

        <p>
          Services account for over 55% of India&apos;s GDP, and GST on services affects millions of
          businesses — from freelance consultants and restaurants to IT companies and hospitals.
          Unlike goods (classified by HSN codes), services are classified using SAC (Services Accounting
          Codes). This guide provides the complete GST rate list for services in 2026, organized by
          sector, with SAC codes and ITC eligibility details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the exact SAC code and rate for any service using our{" "}

        <h2>Understanding SAC Codes</h2>
        <p>
          SAC (Services Accounting Code) is a 6-digit code used to classify services under GST.
          All SAC codes start with &quot;99&quot;. The structure is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First 2 digits (99):</strong> Identifies it as a service</li>
          <li><strong>Next 2 digits:</strong> Service group (e.g., 9983 = IT services)</li>
          <li><strong>Last 2 digits:</strong> Specific service type (e.g., 998311 = Management consulting)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          SAC codes must be mentioned on tax invoices for services. For businesses with turnover
          above ₹5 crore, the full 6-digit code is mandatory.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is the GST rate for IT services?</h3>
        <p>
          All IT services — software development, web hosting, cloud computing, SaaS, consulting — attract
          18% GST. Exports of IT services are zero-rated (0% with ITC) when the recipient is outside India
          and payment is in convertible foreign exchange.
        </p>

        <h3>Are healthcare services exempt from GST?</h3>
        <p>
          Clinical services by hospitals, doctors, and paramedics are exempt. However, cosmetic surgery
          (non-reconstructive), hospital rooms above ₹5,000/day, and health insurance attract GST. Diagnostic
          labs and telemedicine are exempt.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the GST rate on restaurant food?</h3>
        <p>
          Most restaurants charge 5% GST without ITC, regardless of whether they are AC or non-AC.
          The exception is restaurants in hotels with room tariff above ₹7,500/night (18% with ITC)
          and outdoor catering services (18% with ITC).
        </p>

        <h3>Is GST applicable on rent?</h3>
        <p>
          Residential rent to unregistered individuals is exempt. If the tenant is GST-registered, 18%
          applies under reverse charge. Commercial rent always attracts 18%. Hotel rooms vary by tariff:
          exempt (≤₹1,000), 12% (₹1,001–₹7,500), 18% (&gt;₹7,500).
        </p>

        <h3>What is the GST on professional services?</h3>
        <p>
          CA, architect, engineer, and consulting services attract 18%. Legal services by an individual
          advocate to a business attract 18% under reverse charge (the business pays). Legal services
          to individuals are exempt.
