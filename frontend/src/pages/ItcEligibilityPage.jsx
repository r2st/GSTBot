            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is Input Tax Credit (ITC) under GST?</h3>
            <p>
              ITC allows businesses to reduce their GST liability by claiming credit for GST
              paid on business purchases. It ensures tax is levied only on value addition
              at each stage of the supply chain.
            </p>

            <h3>What are blocked credits under Section 17(5)?</h3>
            <p>
              Blocked credits include GST on motor vehicles (with exceptions), food &amp;
              beverages, club memberships, personal consumption, gifts, construction of
              immovable property (except plant &amp; machinery), and composition scheme purchases.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the conditions for claiming ITC?</h3>
            <p>
              Under Section 16(2): valid tax invoice, goods/services received, supplier has
              paid GST, relevant return filed, invoice appears in GSTR-2B, and payment made
              to supplier within 180 days.
            </p>

            <h3>Can ITC be claimed on motor vehicles?</h3>
            <p>
              Generally blocked. Exceptions: vehicles for goods transport, passenger transport
              (&gt;13 seats), driving training, or further supply by dealers/lessors.
            </p>

            <h3>What happens if payment is not made within 180 days?</h3>
            <p>
              The ITC claimed must be reversed with interest. The credit can be reclaimed
              when payment is eventually made to the supplier.
