            <h2>Understanding GST Filing Deadlines</h2>
            <p>
              GST-registered businesses in India must file periodic returns with the government.
              Missing a deadline attracts a late fee of ₹50 per day (₹20 for nil returns) up to
              a maximum of ₹10,000, plus 18% annual interest on the outstanding tax.
            </p>

            <h3>Monthly vs Quarterly Filing</h3>
            <p>
              Businesses with turnover up to ₹5 crore can opt for the QRMP (Quarterly Return
              Monthly Payment) scheme, filing GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B quarterly instead of monthly.
              Under QRMP, the Invoice Furnishing Facility (IFF) lets you upload B2B invoices
              monthly so your buyers can claim ITC without waiting for the quarter.
            </p>

            <h3>GSTR-3B Due Dates for Quarterly Filers</h3>
            <p>
              Quarterly GSTR-3B deadlines vary by state. Category A states (Chhattisgarh,
              Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
              Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Daman &amp; Diu, Puducherry, and others) file by the
              22nd. Category B states (remaining states and UTs) file by the 24th.
            </p>

            <h3>Annual Returns</h3>
            <p>
              GSTR-9 is the annual return required for all regular taxpayers. GSTR-9C, the
              self-certified reconciliation statement, is additionally required for taxpayers
              with turnover exceeding ₹5 crore. Both are due by 31st December of the following
              financial year.
            </p>

            <h3>Composition Scheme — CMP-08</h3>
            <p>
              Dealers under the composition scheme file CMP-08 quarterly instead of monthly
              GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. The quarterly statement is due by the 18th of the month
              following the quarter. They also file an annual return (GSTR-4) by 30th April
              of the following year.
