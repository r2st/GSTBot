// the tax. The API has always taken all four; nothing in the app could send

//
// `paid_at` is the expensive one. Rule 37 reverses the whole of an invoice's
// credit once it is 180 days unpaid, and with no way to record a payment every
// purchase stayed unpaid for ever — so a business six months into using GSTBot
// had credit reversed on invoices it had settled on time, in a GSTR-3B it then
// filed. `is_capital_good` fails the other way: left false, a machine's credit
// is claimed whole in the month of purchase instead of over Rule 43's sixty
// months, which is over-claimed credit.
//
// Kept in their own group because the server keeps them in one: correcting an
// extracted field marks the invoice reviewed, and recording a payment does not.
