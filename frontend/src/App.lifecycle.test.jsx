/**
 * One month, start to finish, through the app a business actually uses.
 *
 * Every page in this suite is tested on its own against a mock written for it,
 * which is the right way to assert what a page does with an answer and the
 * wrong way to assert that the answer one page produced is the one the next
 * page asks about. A per-page fixture hands each screen its data directly, so
 * the handoffs — the invoice the upload created appearing in the register, the
 * run reconciling what was uploaded rather than what was seeded, the return
 * declaring the sale — are exactly what those tests cannot see.
 *
 * So this file mounts the whole app the way `main.jsx` does, over the single
 * mutable server in `test/backend.js`, and walks the lifecycle by clicking:
 * upload → parse → reconcile → file. The assertions are on what carried over
 * from the previous step, not on arithmetic the page tests already own.
 *
 * The clock is fixed at 14 May 2026 so "the month you are filing for" is
 * April: every period picker in the app opens on the current month, and a
 * return for a month that has not ended is one the server refuses to record.
