/**
 * What the app says when it refuses, held to the standard a person reads it at.
 *
 * `backend/tests/test_error_prose.py` does this for the API, and its opening
 * argument applies here unchanged: every other test owns the *shape* of a
 * failure — that a banner appears, that a field is marked, that the token is
 * dropped — and none of them says anything about the sentence, which is the
 * whole of what the user gets. A refusal can put the right element on screen
 * and still be useless. "Unexpected token '<'", "Load failed", "Cannot read
 * properties of null (reading 'total')" would each satisfy every assertion in
 * this suite about the element they appear in.
 *
 * The frontend's messages come from two places, and only one of them can be
 * read out of the source:
 *
 *   * the sentences somebody wrote — in `validate.js`, in a page's own
 *     refusal, in a fallback. Swept out of the files themselves rather than
 *     out of the screens somebody remembered to test.
 *   * the sentences `lib/api.js` *builds*, which exist only as a status code
 *     and a template until a response arrives. Those are gone and got: every
 *     status the client can meet is driven through it and the message it
 *     produces is read off the error it throws.
 *
 * The rules are the backend's, for the reason that file gives — a test cannot
 * tell whether a sentence is kind, but it can tell that the sentence names a
 * type, quotes an identifier, or is four hundred characters of a stack frame,
 * and those are how this goes wrong in practice. They are restated rather than
 * imported because the two suites do not share a runtime, and a frontend list
 * needs frontend words: a browser refusal fails by saying `fetch`, `JSON` or
 * `localStorage`, never by saying `psycopg`.
