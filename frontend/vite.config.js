      // `functions` sat below the rest for as long as v8's count of inline JSX
      // arrows was the reason it could not reach the others: a component whose
      // lines are fully covered still scores under 100 when it renders a row
      // of handlers no single test clicks. 87 → 95 when the flow tests landed
      // and drove the app across pages, which measured 97.
      //
      // The remaining three points were not the JSX artifact at all. They were
      // one handler, written seven times: the `onDismiss` on every page's
      // error banner, which no test had ever clicked — the banner's appearance
      // is what each page test was written about, and the × beside it went in
      // with it and was asserted nowhere. `src/App.dismiss.test.jsx` sweeps
      // the route table for it and the measured figure is 100, so the gate
      // joins the other three at one point under what the suite reaches.
      //
      // `branches` is at 99.5 rather than at the 99.81 actually measured, and
      // the gap is deliberate. Three branches are unreachable by construction
      // and are left in as guards rather than deleted:
      //
      //   * InvoiceDetailPage's `draft[field] ?? ""` — `adopt` already
      //     coerces every field, and the form does not render without an
      //     invoice.
      //   * validate.js's `Number.isFinite(value) ? value : null` — a field
      //     the amount check let through is finite by then.
      //   * ReconcilePage's `|| "Could not load this period."` — every
      //     rejection this page can see is raised by `lib/api.js`, and since
      //     `errorMessage` stopped being able to produce a blank line there is
      //     no API failure left with an empty message. It now answers a
      //     rejection from somewhere else, which is why it stays.
      //
      // A gate at the measured figure would make removing any of those guards
      // the way to keep CI green.
