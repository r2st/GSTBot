// ESLint flat config.
//
// Scoped deliberately narrowly. The point of linting this codebase is to catch
// the mistakes that survive a passing test suite — a hook called conditionally,
// a variable that no longer exists, a dependency array that silently stales a
// closure. Style is not in scope: the source is hand-formatted, and a rule that
// rewrites it would churn every file without making anything more correct.
// That mirrors the backend, where ruff lints but `ruff format` is not run.
