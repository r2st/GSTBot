"""The migrations and the models, checked against each other.

Every other test in this suite runs against a schema built by
``Base.metadata.create_all``. No deployment ever does that: the server runs
``alembic upgrade head`` and the API then issues ORM queries against whatever
that produced. CI covers part of the difference already — it applies the
migrations to a real Postgres, walks them down to base and back up, and runs
``alembic check`` against the models. What none of that reaches:

- **Rolling back to a revision that is not base.** CI's round trip goes all the
  way down, where the first migration drops every table wholesale. A later
  downgrade can forget every column it added and still leave an empty database
  behind, so the step passes. But a rollback in production goes back *one*
  release, and what it has to produce is the schema the previous release ran
  on. That property is asserted here, per revision, by comparing the schema
  after ``upgrade head; downgrade R`` against the schema after plain
  ``upgrade R``.
- **A branched or orphaned history.** Two heads make ``upgrade head`` refuse to
  choose, and a revision whose parent was mistyped is skipped in silence. Both
  surface in CI as an opaque alembic error in a step near the end of the job,
  if at all; here they are a named test with the revision ids in the message.
- **Running at all before the push.** These take seconds and need nothing
  installed, so drift is caught while the change is still being written.

By default the scratch database is a throwaway SQLite file, which the
migrations support on purpose — non-native enums, ``JSON`` with a Postgres
variant, ``batch_alter_table`` for the rewrites. That much cannot see
Postgres-only behaviour, and ``batch_alter_table`` is precisely where the two
diverge: SQLite rebuilds the table, Postgres issues a real ``ALTER``. So the
URL is overridable — CI sets ``MIGRATION_TEST_DATABASE_URL`` to the Postgres
service and runs this module a second time against it, and the rollback
property is then checked on the engine that actually ships.

Alembic runs in a subprocess throughout. ``alembic/env.py`` reads
``settings.database_url`` at import, and ``settings`` is a module-level
singleton already bound to the suite's in-memory database by the time any test
imports — so in-process the migrations would either run nowhere or run over the
fixture data.
