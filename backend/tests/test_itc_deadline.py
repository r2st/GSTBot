"""s.16(4): the deadline that destroys credit rather than deferring it.

Every test here fixes ``as_of``. The whole subject of the module is the
distance between an invoice date and the 30th of November following its
financial year, so a suite that read the clock would assert something
different every morning — and would quietly stop testing the expired branch
altogether once the fixture dates fell behind the wall calendar.

The dates are chosen so two financial years are in play at once with only one
of them at risk:

* 2025-06-10 → FY 2025-26 → deadline 30 Nov 2026
* 2026-05-20 → FY 2026-27 → deadline 30 Nov 2027

and ``AS_OF`` sits exactly sixty days before the first of those, which is the
lead window's boundary. That gives the near year an alert and the far year
none, so a test that accidentally widens the window fails rather than passing
with an extra row nobody looked at.
