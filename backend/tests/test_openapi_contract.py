"""The published spec must describe what the routes actually answer.

The other sweeps in this suite check that a route *behaves* correctly — that it
resolves its tenant, that it carries a bucket, that a cross-tenant read 404s.
This one checks that the document we hand to client authors agrees with them.

It exists because the two conditional error codes were declared once on the
FastAPI app and inherited by all 44 routes, which published a 401 for the seven
public endpoints that take no token and a 429 for the one probe deliberately
exempt from the limiter. Nothing failed: a spec is only wrong when someone
believes it, and the people who believe it are downstream.
