"""Three ways a row that has not been read, or a total that was never printed,
reached a figure a business acts on.

The three are separate defects with one shape in common: some part of the
product answered a question about money from a different set of rows, or a
different column, than the return it sits beside does. Each of them left two
numbers on screen that describe the same thing and disagree, with nothing to say
which one is wrong.

1. :func:`~app.services.invoice_service.tax_summary` excluded ``FAILED`` alone
   where every other money path excludes
   :data:`~app.models.invoice.UNREADABLE_STATUSES`.
2. :attr:`~app.models.invoice.Invoice.invoice_value` did not exist, so the
   screens read a ``total_value`` column that is zero whenever the extractor
   found no grand-total *label* — while every export derived the real figure.
3. The heuristic reverse-charge reader could only ever answer yes, because the
   label word "Applicable" satisfied the pattern's affirmative.
