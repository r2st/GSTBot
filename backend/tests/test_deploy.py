"""Checks over the deployment manifests in ``deploy/``.

None of this runs on the server, so nothing here can prove the deployment
works. What it can prove is that the files agree with each other and with the
application — which is where this class of configuration actually goes wrong.
A port changed in a unit and not in the site block, an upload limit raised in
the env file past what the edge will accept, a module path that was renamed in
``app/`` months after the ``ExecStart`` line was written: each of those is
silent until a deploy, and each is a string comparison here.

The other half is the production configuration itself. ``gstbot.env.example``
is fed through the real ``Settings`` model, so the template ships in a state
that boots cleanly and logs no warnings — and the assertion that it does is
the same code path the server runs.

What makes this deployment unusual, and what most of the cross-checks below
exist for: **the box is shared**. Caddy is a container belonging to another
product, Postgres and Redis are shared clusters, and the ports are allocated
across four applications. So the failure mode is not only "GSTBot is
misconfigured" but "GSTBot collides with something already running" — a
duplicated Redis database, a port another product owns, a bind address the
containerised edge cannot reach. Those are the assertions with teeth here.
