"""The daily filing-deadline sweep: what it says, when, and how often.

Every test here fixes ``today`` rather than letting the sweep read the clock.
That is not only determinism: the whole subject of this module is the distance
between a date and a deadline, so a suite that ran against the real date would
assert something different every morning and would pass or fail depending on
which side of the 11th it was run.

The dates below are chosen so one period, 2026-04, has both of its returns in
play at once: GSTR-1 was due on the 11th of May and GSTR-3B is due on the 20th.
A sweep on the 14th therefore has one overdue return and one approaching
deadline for the same tenant, which is the case the wording, the severity
ladder and the reopening rules all have to get right together.
