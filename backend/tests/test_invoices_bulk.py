"""Bulk invoice upload: the same validation as a single upload, per file.

A batch is a person dragging a folder of paperwork in, and one bad or
duplicate page in it must not cost the other forty-nine — see
``POST /invoices/bulk`` in app/routers/invoices.py. The tests below are mostly
about that isolation: every file gets its own verdict, and the request itself
only fails for something that is wrong about the *batch* (too many files),

    lazy loads off an instance that every file's commit expires, so both were a
    fresh ``SELECT`` on ``businesses`` for *every* file rather than just the
