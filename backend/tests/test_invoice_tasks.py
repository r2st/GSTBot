"""The worker-side half of an invoice upload.

An upload is answered 201 before anything is extracted, so this task is where
the actual work happens and it runs with nobody waiting on it. That changes
what correctness means: there is no caller to return an error to, so the only
outcomes that matter are "the row ends up in a state the user can act on" and
"the worker's database connection is released".

The task body is called directly rather than through a broker. What is under
test is this function's own decisions — the missing-row guard, the retry
boundary, the session lifecycle — and a live Redis would test Celery's
transport instead.
