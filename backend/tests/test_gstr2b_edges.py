"""GSTR-2B files that are not the file the happy path assumes.

tests/test_gstr2b.py reads a well-formed portal download. This covers what
arrives instead: exports whose period is written the other way round, sections
holding nulls where objects were promised, CSVs with no headings, and the
question of what period a statement belongs to when nothing in it says.

The reason these matter more than usual is that a 2B is the *authority* in
reconciliation — it is what the tenant's own books are judged against. A file
half-read is worse than a file rejected, because the invoices it silently
dropped come back as "missing from the portal", which reads as a supplier who
failed to file and is the finding an accountant acts on.

    A business uploads its 2B as the portal's JSON or as the CSV the portal

    downloaded — not a statement about the invoices. So a column that says
    credit is unavailable has to be read as unavailable in both, and the two
    readers here used to hold separate vocabularies for it: the CSV checked a
    private four-word set, the JSON went through the shared reader's eleven,
    and neither contained the other.

    The gaps ran one way, which is why this is a contract and not a tidy-up.
    Every word one reader missed was a *refusal* it read as consent, so tax the
    portal has withheld was counted claimable — it lands in ``itc_eligible``
    instead of ``itc_at_risk``, and the business is told a claim is safe in the
    precise case a notice is coming. Parametrised over both shapes rather than
    asserted twice, so a spelling added to one reader cannot quietly stay
