"""The half of the workflow that happens after the download.

``test_end_to_end.py`` drives the product up to the export and stops there,
which is where the user leaves for the portal. This file starts there — at the
one event GSTIndia cannot observe. Nothing in the API knows a return was filed
until the business says so, and almost everything the product does afterwards
turns on that one fact: the filing status screen, the deadline alerts, the late
fee, and whether tomorrow's sweep nags about a return that is already done.

Same rule as the other journey file: a step is an HTTP request, and each one
uses a period, an id or a figure that came out of the previous response, so
what is under test is the handoff rather than arithmetic ``test_filing.py`` and
``test_alerting.py`` already own.

**The one exception is the sweep.** It is the product's own step, not a user's
— Celery beat runs it nightly (see ``app/celery_app.py``) and there is no route
that triggers it, deliberately, because an endpoint that raises every tenant's
alerts is not a thing a tenant should be able to call. A journey about being
nagged and then left alone has to include it, so it is called directly and
marked at each call site.

**No hardcoded periods.** The filing status endpoint reports a window that
moves with the calendar, and the deadline alerts and s.16(4) sweep read the
same window. A period written into this file is one that eventually falls out
of it and takes these tests red for the date rather than for the code — so
every journey below asks the product which periods it is tracking and files one
of those.
