"""The file on disk when the row that names it is never written.

``create_pending_invoice`` writes the bytes before it inserts the row, and it
has to: ``storage_path`` is a column on that row, so the path must exist to be
stored. That ordering is fine as long as the commit succeeds. When it does not,
the file is left behind with nothing in the database pointing at it — and
nothing ever will:

* no query reads ``upload_dir``; every read starts from ``Invoice.storage_path``
* the delete route keeps stored files on purpose, so it is not a sweeper either
* there is no sweeper

So every upload that meets a full connection pool, a dropped connection, or a
constraint used to leave a permanent orphan, on a volume sized for the rows
that exist rather than for the ones that failed to be written.

The cleanup is best effort by design. These tests pin both halves of that: the
file goes away, and a cleanup that cannot run does not replace the failure the
caller is entitled to see.
