"""Reconciliation's defensive edges: bad data, and the run that fails.

test_reconciliation.py covers the matching itself — what counts as the same
invoice, what the credit arithmetic does with it. This file covers what
happens when the inputs are not the clean case, which for a reconciliation
engine is most of the time: an invoice whose extraction produced neither a
GSTIN nor a number, a stored 2B whose JSON has been hand-edited, a finding
about a supplier nobody can identify, and the run that raises partway through.

The through-line is that none of these may lose a period. A reconciliation is
evidence for an ITC claim that may be questioned years later, so a run that
goes wrong has to leave a row saying so — a run that vanishes looks exactly
like a period nobody reconciled.
