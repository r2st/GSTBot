"""The role on a login decided nothing until this file existed.

``UserRole`` has been stored since the first migration, returned by
``/auth/me``, carried over onto a linked business by ``POST
/businesses/mine/link``, and displayed in the business switcher. Nothing read
it. A ``viewer`` — the role a business gives the person it wants to *show* the
books to — could upload invoices, patch the figures on one, delete it, import
a GSTR-2B over the statement a reconciliation had already run against, and
record a return as filed, which silences the deadline alert for a filing that
never happened.

Two properties are asserted here, and the second is the one a per-router habit
would get wrong:

* A read-only role is refused every write. :class:`TestEveryMutatingRouteIsGated`
  sweeps that off the assembled route table rather than trusting the list of
  routes that happen to be gated today.
* The role that decides is the role *on the business being acted for*, not the
  role on the login. An owner of their own books who has been linked into a
  client's as a viewer is a viewer there, and the reverse — a viewer at home
  who owns a linked business — must not be locked out of books they own.
