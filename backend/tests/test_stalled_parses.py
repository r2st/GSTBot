"""Invoices a worker picked up and never put down.

``process_invoice`` writes every failure it can catch onto the row, so the only
way to stay in ``processing`` is for the process to stop existing between the
commit that claims the row and the one that records an outcome: the 240s hard
time limit, the OOM killer choosing the child holding a decoded PDF, or a
redeploy mid-document. No ``except`` runs in any of those.

What made that worth a sweep rather than a shrug is where the row then sits.
``PROCESSING`` is in ``UNREADABLE_STATUSES``, so the GSTR-1, the period's output
tax, the credit pool, the reconciliation and the supplier's exposure all skip
it — right, because nothing has read it. But the dashboard's needs-review count
is ``PARSED`` plus ``FAILED``, and the register renders the status as a neutral
"Processing" chip. So the one document missing from the return is the one
document the product shows as work in hand, on no screen, forever.

These tests are about that invisibility as much as about the status: the point
of reaping to ``FAILED`` is that the row starts being counted and complained
about, while not one rupee of any return moves.
