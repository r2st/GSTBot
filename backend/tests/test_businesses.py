"""Multi-GSTIN access: listing, linking, unlinking, and X-Business-Id.

A GSTBot sign-up is one GSTIN, so a company or a practice with several
registrations ends up with several separate logins. This is the router that
lets one of those logins reach the others — see app/routers/businesses.py —
and the tests below cover the three moving parts: proving you hold the other
account's password before a link is created, listing what one login can now
act for, and the header that actually switches which business a request acts

    ``get_active_tenant`` checked both, ``/businesses/mine`` checked only

    disagreement was reachable, and each one showed up as the product
    contradicting itself rather than as an error anyone could act on.

    are the *same* answer, which is the property that actually broke — and
