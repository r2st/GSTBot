"""The product, driven the way a business drives it, over HTTP only.

Every other file in this suite tests one layer. This one tests the seams
between them, which is where the bugs that reach users actually live: an
invoice whose extracted period does not match the period the 2B import
derived, a reconciliation run whose ITC figure the summary endpoint recomputes
differently, an export that disagrees with the preview the user just approved.
Each of those passes every unit test on both sides of the seam.

So nothing here reaches into the database or calls a service directly. A
journey is a sequence of requests, each one using an id or a period that came
out of the previous response, and the assertions are on the handoffs rather
than on arithmetic that ``test_reconciliation.py`` and ``test_itc.py`` already
own.

The model is stubbed rather than absent (see ``stub_openrouter``): a
production deployment has ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` set, so the extraction path
these journeys run through is the one the server runs. ``CELERY_ENABLED`` is
false in this suite, so the parse that the worker would do happens inline —
which is the same code, called from the same place, and is exactly what the
API does when the broker is unreachable.

    "Place of supply is missing and cannot be derived from a GSTIN" is raised
    per invoice and blocks the whole period, and it is the only error on that
    list with no second source to fall back on: a B2B sale gets the state off
    the buyer's GSTIN, and a B2C one has nothing. So this is the loop the
    invoice screen's place-of-supply field exists to close — validate, correct,
    validate again, file — and it crosses three modules that are otherwise
    tested apart.

    What makes it worth a journey rather than a unit test is what the export
    does *while* the period is blocked. ``gstr1`` does not refuse an invoice it
    cannot place; it falls back to the business's own state, so an unfixed sale
    is not missing from the return — it is in it, declared in the wrong state,
    under a heading that contradicts its own tax. The error is the only thing

    ``test_rbac.py`` sweeps the route table twice over: every mutating route
    carries the gate, and every gated route refuses a real viewer. Both are
    per-route questions asked of an empty request, and neither can answer the
    one a business actually asks — *if I give my CA read-only access, do they
    see my books, and are my books the same afterwards?*

    So this is the sequence rather than the surface: a month is prepared by
    its owner, a second login is granted access to it, every screen that login
    would open is read through the ``X-Business-Id`` header, every write it
    could reach is refused, and the whole read surface is compared against the
    snapshot taken before. A gate that refuses the request and a write that
    happens anyway are different failures, and only the comparison sees the
    second.
