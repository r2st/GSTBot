"""Pytest fixtures: in-memory SQLite plus a FastAPI client with overrides.

Nothing external is touched. No OpenRouter key is set, so every AI path
degrades to its deterministic fallback — which means the suite also asserts
that those fallbacks actually work, rather than only exercising the happy
path against a mock.

The same rule is applied to Redis: the URL points at a port nothing listens on,
so the rate limiter uses its in-process fallback and a developer who happens to
be running Redis locally does not get counters that survive between test runs.
The ``rate_limited`` fixture is how the limiter itself gets tested.

    refuses to start with DEBUG=true when ENVIRONMENT is production *or*
    staging. But the test configuration is development with debug on, so left
    alone the suite exercises Starlette's page rather than the handler.

    It lives here rather than in ``test_errors.py``, where it started as an

    anywhere else, and the difference is nearly undetectable: reaching
    ``/_test_errors/unhandled`` from any other file answered 500 with
