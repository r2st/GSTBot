"""Every query over a business-scoped table names the business it reads for.

The behavioural sweeps — ``test_tenancy_contract.py``, ``test_active_business_
contract.py`` — prove it of every *route*: a rival's row 404s, a switched
request never sees the home books. What they cannot reach is a query that no
route runs. A service function called only from a Celery task, or one branch of
a helper the route tests never take, can drop the ``business_id`` predicate and
pass both sweeps, because nothing they drive gets there.

So this file reads the source instead. Every ``select``/``update``/``delete``
statement in ``app/`` that touches a table carrying ``BusinessScopedMixin`` must
compare ``business_id`` somewhere in the statement — directly, or through a
``*conditions`` list built in the same function that does. The handful that
deliberately read across every tenant are listed by name with the reason, so
a new one is a decision made in this file rather than a query nobody noticed.

Static and therefore blunt: it cannot tell a predicate that is *correct* from
one that is *present*, and the behavioural sweeps remain what proves the former.
What it catches is the absence, which is the case those sweeps are blind to.
