"""Edge cases for the input cleaning applied at the edge.

The interesting inputs here are not "a name with an apostrophe" — SQLAlchemy
binds parameters and that was never a problem. They are the ones that turn a
value into something other than data: a wildcard that makes an indexed search a
full scan, a newline that forges a log line, a filename that walks out of the
upload directory.
