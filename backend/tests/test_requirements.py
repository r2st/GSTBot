"""The declared dependency floors against what is actually installed.

Every line in requirements.txt is a `>=` floor rather than a pin, so nothing
here checks that a particular version is present — the deployment is free to
resolve newer. What it checks is the other direction: that the floor is a claim
the environment can back up.

That matters because the floors are maintained by Dependabot, which raises them
without ever running the suite against the raised number. A bumped floor is
therefore an assertion nobody verified: the PR says "this project needs at least
alembic 1.18.5" while CI installs whatever pip resolves and the tests pass for
reasons unrelated to the floor. If the two drift — a floor raised above what is
resolvable, or a package dropped from the file but still imported — the failure
surfaces at `pip install` on a clean machine, which is the worst place for it.

Asserting floor <= installed catches the drift here instead, and makes the next
floor bump self-verifying: the suite either runs against a version that honours
the new floor or it goes red.
