"""Every parse leaves one structured line, and it names the tenant.

Until GB003 a parse that *worked* logged nothing: the task's return value went
to a result backend nobody reads, so the one number that says whether the
model provider is earning its keep — how often extraction fell back to the
heuristics — could only be had by querying ``parsed_with`` off the rows. The
failure line existed but named the invoice id alone, in a product where every
support question starts with which business asked it.

Written against the upload route rather than ``process_invoice`` directly,
because with no broker in the test environment the upload parses inline and
that is the path an ordinary deployment without Redis takes too.
