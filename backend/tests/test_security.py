"""Password hashing and access tokens, tested directly.

These are exercised through /auth already, but only along the paths a working
client takes. What matters here is the other kind of input: a corrupt hash out
of the database, a token signed with somebody else's secret, a token that was
minted for a different purpose. Each of those is a way in if it is handled
loosely, and none of them is reachable from the HTTP tests.
