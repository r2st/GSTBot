"""The two sweeps that read every tenant at once must read them through an index.

Every other query in the product is tenant-scoped, and every index on these
tables leads with ``business_id`` to serve it. The periodic sweeps are the
exception: they ask "what does *anyone* have", constrain no ``business_id``, and
so cannot use any of those indexes — a leading column the query does not
constrain cannot be searched.

That failure is silent in the way that keeps it. The reaper commits only when it
found something, so on a healthy deployment a full scan of the invoices table
produces no rows, no log line and no error — just an hourly cost that grows with
the table. It went unnoticed long enough for the beat entry to describe it as
"one indexed query" while the index it named did not exist.

So these tests plan the SQL the production functions actually emit, rather than
asserting that an index is declared. A declaration is not a plan: the reaper was
already covered by ``ix_invoices_business_status`` on paper, and that index
cannot answer its query. Capturing the statement also means a predicate that
drifts away from the index — a column added to the ``WHERE``, a status test
rewritten — fails here rather than quietly reverting to a scan.

Both tests seed a table shaped like a real one and ``ANALYZE`` before planning,
because an index is only ever *offered* to the planner; which one it takes is a
cost decision, and with no statistics SQLite guesses from the query alone. On an
unanalysed table it picks ``ix_alerts_deleted_at`` for the digest — an index on
the column that is null for every live row, so the "search" it plans reads the
whole table anyway. That is the same wrong answer as before the fix and it looks
like a different one, which is precisely what these tests exist to tell apart.
The rows below are what make the choice mean something: a long history, almost
all of it closed, with the handful the sweep wants at the far end of it.
