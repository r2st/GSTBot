"""The alert list, and the two things a business can do to an alert.

The sweep in ``test_alerting.py`` decides what gets raised; this is about what a
business can then see and close. The two files meet in one place on purpose —
``TestDismissingIsWhatTheSweepRespects`` dismisses through the API and then runs
the sweep — because that loop is the actual feature. A dismissal the sweep
ignored would still pass every test in this file individually.

Alerts here are inserted rather than swept up, so that severities, due dates and
statuses can be arranged deliberately. Two of them are not filing deadlines at
all: the listing is the one part of this that is not about deadlines
specifically, and a type filter tested only against rows of a single type proves
nothing.
