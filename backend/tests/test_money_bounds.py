"""The ceiling on an amount, at every door a figure comes in through.

A money column here is ``Numeric(16, 2)`` — fourteen digits before the point.
Nothing enforced that. ``ge=0`` was on every amount a caller could send and
nothing was on the other end, so ``1E+100`` in a correction was a 200.

What makes this worth a file of its own is *where* it broke. Not at the write:

*   Postgres refuses the INSERT and SQLite keeps whatever it was handed, so the
    deployment and the suite disagree about whether there is a problem at all.
*   The failure lands on the **read**. Every figure in this product is
    quantized to the paisa on its way out, and ``Decimal.quantize`` raises
    ``InvalidOperation`` rather than rounding once the result needs more than
    the decimal context's 28 significant digits. One overlarge row is therefore
    not a wrong number on one screen — it is a 500 on the dashboard, the ITC
    summary and the GSTR-3B preview, for as long as the row is there, caused by
    a write that answered 200 an hour earlier.

So the tests below come in pairs: the door refuses the figure, *and* the
screens that would have broken still answer. The second half is the real
assertion — the bound exists to keep a read working, and a bound that stopped
the write while something else still poisoned the row would pass the first half
alone.

The doors are: a hand correction (``PATCH /invoices/{id}``), a what-if
(``POST /itc/set-off``), the Rule 42 turnovers in a query string, an uploaded
GSTR-2B, and whatever the extraction model decided to return.
