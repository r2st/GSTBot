"""The guards that sit in front of a route rather than inside one.

Three separate defects, one shape: a bound the product believed it had and did
not, because the thing enforcing it was somewhere other than where it was being
read.

* ``POST /itc/set-off`` was the only endpoint outside ``/health*`` and
  ``/meta/*`` that answered without a bearer token, against a published
  contract saying otherwise and against its own comment.
* No route bounded the size of the body it was handed. The upload routes
  measured the file *after* Starlette had received and buffered it, and the
  JSON routes did not measure at all.
* ``/api/v1/health`` skipped the global rate limiter, because the limiter was
  reading the list of paths that exist to keep the *access log* quiet.

The last class here guards the same shape prospectively rather than
retrospectively: which routes are metered was, until it, a per-router habit
with nothing sweeping it.
