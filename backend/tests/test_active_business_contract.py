"""Switching business is a contract over the route table, not a habit per router.

``tests/test_tenancy_contract.py`` sweeps the boundary between two *logins*.
This file sweeps the one inside a single login: a user who has linked a second
GSTIN sends ``X-Business-Id`` and every subsequent request must act for that
business and no other. The two are not the same check. A route that resolves
its tenant from the token rather than from ``get_current_business`` passes the
cross-tenant sweep perfectly — the rival still gets a 404 — while quietly
answering a switched request with the caller's *own* books. That is the shape
of the bug this file exists to catch, and it is a data-leak the user cannot
even see, because both sets of books legitimately belong to them.

``test_businesses.py`` already covers the header itself: which ids are honoured,
which are refused, and that a switch is revoked by unlinking. What it checks the
header *does* is one dashboard read and one upload. Twenty-nine other
business-scoped routes were taking the header on trust.

So the tenant under test here is seeded with rows carrying markers no other
business could produce, and then every business-scoped route is called with the
header pointing at a second, empty business. Nothing that comes back may contain
a marker. A route added later is swept without being named, which is the point:
:class:`TestTheSweepCoversEveryBusinessScopedRoute` fails while the route is
being written rather than after one client's books have been served to another.
