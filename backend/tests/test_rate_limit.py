"""Rate limiting: the spec parser, the key derivation, and the enforcement.

The key derivation is the part worth most of these tests. Getting it wrong is
not a performance bug — keying on the connection address means a whole office
behind one NAT shares a login budget, and trusting X-Forwarded-For without a
proxy in front means the limit can be bypassed by sending a header.
