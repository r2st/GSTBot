"""The workflow that is supposed to be checking everything else.

Two things go wrong with a CI file, and neither of them shows up as a failing
run — which is the whole problem, because a failing run is the only signal
anyone is watching for.

The first is a check that was never added. ``deploy/`` ships a Caddyfile, four
systemd units and a release script, and none of them is exercised by importing
the application, so none of them was parsed by anything until the ``deploy``
job existed. A missing brace in the Caddyfile is not a test failure; it is
``systemctl reload caddy`` failing partway through a release.

The second is a version that drifted apart. CI installs one Python, the image
builds on the one in its Dockerfile, and the server installs the one the
runbook names. Nothing makes those the same number, and when they stop being
the same number the suite goes on passing against a runtime nobody deploys.

So everything here reads the workflow as data and asserts that what runs is
what some other file in the repository already claims runs.
