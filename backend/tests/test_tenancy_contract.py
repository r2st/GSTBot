"""Tenancy as a contract over the route table, not a habit per router.

Every router already scopes its lookups to the calling business, and most of
them have a test that says so — ``test_invoices.py`` checks the invoice detail
route, ``test_alerts.py`` the two alert routes, ``test_supplier_score.py`` the
supplier one. Those tests are good and they stay. What none of them can do is
notice a route that *nobody wrote a test for*: ``POST
/invoices/{invoice_id}/reparse`` shipped correctly scoped and completely
unchecked, and the only reason that was safe is that whoever wrote it happened
to reach for ``_owned_invoice``. The next one might reach for ``db.get``.

So this file sweeps the assembled route table instead of naming routes. Any
route with an ``*_id`` path parameter has to appear in :data:`FACTORIES` with a
way to build a row for one tenant, and is then called by the *other* tenant and
required to answer 404. Add a route with a row id in its path and
:class:`TestEveryRowIdRouteIsCovered` fails until it is listed here — which is
the whole point, because the failure arrives while the route is being written
rather than after a business has read another business's books.

404 rather than 403 throughout, for the reason the individual tests already
give: a 403 confirms the id exists, and ids are sequential, so a competitor's
invoice count is a loop away.

The paired owner check in :class:`TestTheSweepIsNotVacuous` is what stops this
file quietly proving nothing. Every assertion here is "the rival got a 404",
and a factory that silently built no row — wrong tenant, missing column, a
route that 404s for everyone — would satisfy that while testing nothing at all.
Asserting the owner does *not* get a 404 from the same URL is what makes the
rival's 404 mean tenancy rather than absence.
