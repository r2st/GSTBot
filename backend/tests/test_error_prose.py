"""What a refusal says, held to the standard a person reads it at.

``test_errors.py`` owns the *shape* of a failure: three keys, a stable code, a
correlation id, and nothing of the exception in a 500. It says nothing about
the sentence, and the sentence is the whole of what the user gets. A refusal
can carry a perfect envelope and still be useless — "IntegrityError on
uq_invoice_business_number", "Input should be a valid integer", "NoneType
object has no attribute 'gstin'" — and every one of those would pass every
assertion in that file.

Two sweeps, because the messages come from two places and only one of them is
obvious:

* every ``detail=`` an ``HTTPException`` is raised with, read out of the source
  rather than out of the routes somebody remembered to test;
* every message on the domain exceptions the routers turn *into* a detail with
  ``str(exc)``, which is where the longest and most user-facing sentences in
  this codebase actually live — the GSTR-2B parser's, the filing recorder's.

The rules below are deliberately about jargon and shape rather than tone. A
test cannot tell whether a sentence is kind. It can tell that the sentence
names a Python type, quotes a database index, or is four hundred characters of
a stack frame, and those are the ways this goes wrong in practice.
