"""Contract checks over the mapper registry.

The tenancy sweeps in ``test_tenancy_contract.py`` prove that a scoped route
cannot read another tenant's row. These prove the layer underneath: that the
*table* is shaped so the scoped query it runs is cheap, and that a new scoped
model cannot be added without that shape.

That guarantee used to be claimed by ``BusinessScopedMixin.__table_args__``,
which built the ``(business_id, created_at)`` index from ``__tablename__``. It
never applied to a single table. Every scoped model declares its own
``__table_args__`` — for a partial unique constraint, or a second composite
index — and a class attribute shadows an inherited ``declared_attr`` outright
rather than merging with it. The index existed on all five tables only because
each model also spelled it out by hand, which is exactly the per-model habit
the mixin was written to remove.

So the guarantee is asserted here instead. A sweep cannot be shadowed by the
next model, and unlike the mixin it fails loudly when the index is missing
rather than looking like it was inherited.
