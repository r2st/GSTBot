"""SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and declarative base.

Uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 style. The engine URL comes from settings, so tests can
override it with an in-memory SQLite database.

The pool is configured rather than left at its defaults, because the defaults
are wrong in both directions for this workload. A GST filing run is bursty —
one business exports a period and fires a dozen queries at once — so the pool
needs overflow; and the API runs behind several worker processes against a
stock Postgres, so ``pool_size`` has to be small enough that the processes
together stay under ``max_connections``.
