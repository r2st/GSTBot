"""Structured logging, and the correlation id that ties a request together.

Every log line carries the id of the request that produced it. That is the
whole point of this module: when a business reports "my April upload failed",
the support answer has to be findable, and an invoice parse touches the API,
a Celery worker and a model provider before it fails. One id, set once at the
edge and propagated into the worker, is what makes those three sets of lines a
single story.

The formatter is chosen by configuration rather than by environment sniffing:
``LOG_FORMAT=json`` for anything shipping to a log aggregator, ``console`` for
a terminal.
