"""Rate limiting: a fixed-window counter, in Redis when there is one.

Why a fixed window rather than a token bucket: the limits here exist to stop
one tenant burning a shared free-tier model quota or brute-forcing a password,
not to shape traffic to the millisecond. A fixed window is two Redis commands
and is exact about the thing that matters — "no more than N in any minute" —
whereas a leaky bucket costs a Lua script for a precision nobody here needs.

Every limit is keyed by *tenant*, not by connection. Behind a NAT, a whole
office shares one IP, and an IP-keyed upload limit would mean the first user in
the building spends everyone's quota. Authenticated callers are therefore keyed
on their user id and only anonymous ones fall back to the address.

With Redis down the limiter falls back to a per-process in-memory window. That
is deliberately weaker — four API processes means four times the limit — but a
weak limit that stays up beats a strong one that takes the API down with the
cache.

Note the absence of ``from __future__ import annotations`` here, unlike the
rest of the package. ``RateLimit`` is a *callable class*, and FastAPI resolves
string annotations against ``call.__globals__`` — which a class instance does
not have. With postponed evaluation on, ``__call__``'s ``request: Request``
stays an unresolved ForwardRef, FastAPI stops recognising it as the request,
and every rate-limited route sprouts a mandatory ``request`` query parameter.
Real annotations keep the dependency wired to the real Request.
