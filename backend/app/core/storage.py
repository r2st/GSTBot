"""The upload volume, as a dependency that can fail.

Every invoice is bytes on disk before it is a row — ``storage_path`` is a
column, so the file has to exist first — which makes the directory behind
``UPLOAD_DIR`` the fourth thing an upload needs after the database, and the
only one of the four that nothing used to watch after boot. A volume that
fills, or that a node remounts read-only, fails every upload with a 500 while
``/health`` goes on answering ``ok``: the startup check had passed, and no
later check existed.

Shaped like :func:`app.core.database.check_database` on purpose — ``(ok,
error_type)`` — so the health route treats the two the same way.
