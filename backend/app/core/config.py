"""Application configuration, loaded from environment / .env.

All settings are typed and validated by pydantic-settings. Nothing sensitive is
hard-coded — secrets come from the environment or the gitignored ``keys/`` dir.

Two rules this module enforces, both at startup rather than at first use:

* **Fail loudly, not silently.** A production deployment with the sample JWT
  secret, a wildcard CORS list, or ``DEBUG=true`` refuses to boot. A
  misconfiguration that only shows up as a security hole three months later is
  worse than a container that will not start.
* **Development stays frictionless.** Every one of those checks is scoped to
  non-development environments, so a fresh clone runs with no ``.env`` at all.
