limiter's rejection and the exception handlers' 500, is logged and answered

#
# "Do not log this" is about volume and is safe to say about any probe. "Do not
# count this" is a hole, and only worth opening for a probe that costs nothing
# to serve: an orchestrator polls liveness every few seconds from one address,
# and rate-limiting it would eventually kill a pod for being healthy — but
# liveness touches no dependency, so an unlimited flood of it costs one dict.
#
# ``/api/v1/health`` is a different endpoint wearing a similar name. It runs a
# ``SELECT 1`` on a pooled connection and pings Redis on every call, and being
# in the exempt set made it the one unauthenticated route in the product that
# could be hammered without limit into the connection pool the API serves every
# tenant from. ``/health/ready`` does the same work and was never exempt, which
# is what gives away that the sharing was accidental rather than a decision.
#
# The global default is 300 a minute per address; a load balancer probing every
# five seconds spends twelve of them, so the probes keep working and the flood
# does not.
#
# ``/metrics`` was the other entry, and there is no such route — no exporter
# has ever been mounted, in this app or in front of it. An exemption naming a
# path nothing serves is not harmless: the limiter checks the path before the
# router does, so every request to it was answered 404 without being counted,
# which is an unmetered path in a set whose whole subject is which paths may go
# uncounted and why. Whichever way a metrics endpoint eventually arrives, the
# decision to exempt it should be made then, against what it costs to serve.

    The upload routes already check ``len(content)`` and answer 413, and that

    a route runs, Starlette has received the whole body and spooled it, and

    JSON routes had no check at all — a 20 MB body to ``/itc/set-off`` was

    ``Content-Length`` is a claim the client makes and this trusts it in the

    refused without being read, and one declaring less is still measured by the
    route that receives it. Under-declaring therefore buys nothing.

    A body with no declared length — chunked transfer encoding — is not bounded
    here, and is the reason the edge's ``request_body max_size`` stays where it
    is rather than being replaced by this. What this adds is the bound the
