    exactly one place. A route that forgets it has no ``business_id`` to filter
    on and fails loudly, instead of quietly reading across tenants.

    Defaults to the caller's own tenant, exactly as it always has — a request
    that never sends ``X-Business-Id`` is unaffected by any of what follows.
    A header naming a *different* business is only honoured when a live
    :class:`~app.models.business_membership.BusinessMembership` links this
    user to it; see ``POST /businesses/mine/link`` for how one gets created.
    Anything else — an id nobody granted, a stale membership, a business that
    has since gone inactive — is a 403 rather than a silent fall-back to the
    caller's own tenant, because a client that believes it is acting for one
    business must never be quietly handed another's data instead.

    FastAPI caches a dependency per request by the callable that declares it,
    so a route depending on both ``get_current_business`` and a
    ``RequireRole`` resolves this once and runs the membership query once.
    That is why the role is returned from here rather than from a second
    dependency that would repeat the lookup.
