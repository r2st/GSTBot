"""Input cleaning applied at the edge, before a value reaches a query or a file.

None of this is SQL-injection defence — every query in the product is built
through SQLAlchemy and passes user values as bound parameters, so a quote in a
supplier name is data and never syntax. What is left after that is a different
and real set of problems:

* **LIKE metacharacters.** ``%`` and ``_`` in a search box are not injection,
  but ``%`` alone turns an indexed prefix search into a full scan of a tenant's
  invoices, and a page of them is a cheap way to make the database work hard.
* **Control characters.** A ``\\r\\n`` in a value that is later logged, or put
  in a ``Content-Disposition`` header, is header and log injection.
* **Filenames.** An uploaded name reaches a filesystem path and a download
  header, and neither should ever see ``../``.
* **Spreadsheet formulas.** A field that starts with ``=`` is a formula to
  Excel, not a trade name, and the CSV exports are opened in Excel by design.
