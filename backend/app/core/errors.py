"""One error shape for the whole API, and the handlers that produce it.

Every failure — a 404 raised by a route, a validation error raised before the
route ran, a constraint violation raised by Postgres, or a bug — leaves through
here and comes back looking the same:

    {
      "detail": "Invoice not found",          # what a human should be told
      "error": {"code": "not_found", "status": 404, ...},
      "correlation_id": "9f2c1a0b4e7d5a63"    # what to quote in a support ticket
    }

``detail`` is kept as the primary field on purpose. It is what FastAPI already
returns, what every existing client reads, and what the frontend's error
formatter understands; ``error`` and ``correlation_id`` are added beside it
rather than replacing it, so hardening the API did not break its consumers.

The other rule here: an unexpected exception is logged in full and answered
with a generic message. A stack trace, a failing SQL statement or a connection
string in an HTTP response is a gift to whoever is probing the service, and the
correlation id is what lets support find the real error without publishing it.
