DESCRIPTION = """
GST compliance for Indian SMBs: read invoices, reconcile them against the
portal's GSTR-2B, work out what input tax credit is actually safe to claim, and
prepare the return.

### Authentication

Every endpoint except `/health*` and `/meta/*` needs a bearer token. Get one
from `POST /auth/register` (which creates the business too) or
`POST /auth/login`, then send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Tenancy

A token identifies a *business* — one GST registration — and every query is
filtered by it. A row belonging to another tenant answers **404**, not 403: a
403 would confirm that the id exists, which is enough to probe a competitor's
invoice volume.

### Errors

Every error has the same shape, whatever raised it:

```json
{
  "detail": "Invoice not found",
  "error": {"code": "not_found", "status": 404, "message": "Invoice not found"},
  "correlation_id": "9f2c1a0b4e7d5a63"
}
```

Branch on `error.code` rather than on the prose in `detail`. The
`correlation_id` also comes back as the `X-Request-ID` header on every
response, and is what support needs to find the request in the logs.

### Rate limits

Responses carry `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining`. A 429 carries
`Retry-After` in seconds. Limits are keyed per authenticated user, falling back
to the client address for anonymous callers — so an office behind one NAT does
not share a single budget.

`POST /auth/login` carries a second budget on top, keyed by the account being
attempted rather than by the caller, so that failed sign-ins against one
account are capped no matter how many addresses they arrive from. It counts
only failures and is handed straight back on a correct password, so a client
that signs in successfully never meets it.

### Money

Every monetary value is a decimal *string*, not a float — `"1234.56"`. GST is
computed to the paisa and a float cannot hold 18% of ₹1,234.56 exactly. Parse
these with a decimal type.
