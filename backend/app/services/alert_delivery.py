"""Emailing the alerts the daily sweep raises.

``app/services/alerting.py`` creates and refreshes ``Alert`` rows and says
plainly what it does not do: reach email, SMS or WhatsApp. ``channel`` and
``sent_at`` stay null on every row until something picks them up. This module
is that something, for email — the one channel :data:`Settings.smtp_host`
makes possible without a second integration.

**One email per business, not one per alert.** A business with three deadlines
approaching at once should see one message, not three — the sweep's own
central rule is not becoming noise, and a digest is the same rule applied to
delivery. Every alert folded into a digest still gets its own ``channel`` and
``sent_at`` stamped individually, so the per-row bookkeeping the sweep's
comment promised is intact; only the transmission is batched.

**What is sendable.** Only ``PENDING`` and ``FAILED`` — an alert already
``READ`` or ``DISMISSED`` means the business has already seen it, in the
product, and an email repeating that is exactly the noise the sweep exists to
avoid. ``FAILED`` stays sendable so a relay outage on one day is retried the
next, without a second sweep having to notice and re-raise anything.

**Isolation.** Committed per business, for the same reason the sweep itself
is: a bad address or a mid-run SMTP outage on one tenant must not cost every
tenant after it its place in today's send.

That is a property of the *writes*, and only of the writes. Every read this
module does — the tenant ids, their recipients, their alerts — happens up
front, across all tenants at once, because a read failing is a failure of the
whole run whichever loop it sits in; there is no tenant to isolate it from.
What the batching has to respect is the commit: it expires every ORM instance
in the session, so anything read before the loop must be plain rows rather
than mapped objects, or the first commit turns the saving back into a
per-instance re-read. Both prefetches obey that, and the loop writes through
``update()`` by id rather than by attribute for the same reason.
