"""Heartbeats for the scheduled jobs, and what the queue behind them looks like.

Beat has no page of its own: a missed nightly sweep is silent unless something
watches for it, which is what ``/health/jobs`` exists to do. Two different
signals, read from two different places:

* **Heartbeats.** Each scheduled task stamps a timestamp into Redis the
  moment it finishes — see :func:`record_heartbeat` — and this reports how
  long ago that was against how often the job is supposed to run. A beat
  process that stopped scheduling entirely leaves every heartbeat exactly as
  stale as the outage is long, which a worker-side check alone would never
  show: the workers themselves are fine, and nothing is telling them to do
  anything.
* **Queue depth.** How many messages are sitting in the broker's list right
  now, read directly off Redis rather than through Celery's ``inspect()`` —
  which asks the *workers*, not the broker, and answers nothing when no
  worker is up to reply. A queue backing up while every worker is dead is
  exactly the situation this exists to catch, and ``inspect`` is blind to it.

Every function here is best-effort and swallows its own failures: this module
exists to report on the health of other things, and a monitoring read must
never itself become the outage.
