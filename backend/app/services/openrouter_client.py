"""The single entry point every AI feature calls.

Free-tier models only, over plain httpx — no SDK, no hidden global state, so
tests mock one function. Two provider quirks shape this module:

* The free reasoning models (``openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`` in particular) often
  return ``content: null`` with the answer parked in ``reasoning``. The client
  falls back to that field rather than crashing on ``None``.
* Free models ignore ``response_format`` about as often as they honour it, so
  callers ask for JSON in the prompt and :func:`extract_json_object` digs the
  object out of whatever prose or markdown fence it arrives wrapped in.

Every caller is expected to handle :class:`OpenRouterError` by falling back to
something deterministic. A free tier is a free tier: it rate-limits, and an
invoice upload must not fail because a model was busy.

That fallback is a real downgrade, though, and it is worth not taking when the
failure is one that goes away by itself. A 429 from the free tier is a
per-minute window that has refilled by the time the caller could have asked
again; the caller's alternative is regex heuristics on the invoice, which is a
materially worse answer for something the model would have got right on the
second try. So transient failures are retried here, and only transient ones — a
401 is a missing key and a 400 is a malformed request, and asking twice turns a
fast, clear error into a slow one.

Two bounds keep that from becoming its own outage. ``Retry-After`` is honoured
when the provider sends it, because guessing shorter just burns the next window
too. And the total time spent waiting is capped, because this runs inline in the
upload request when Celery is off — a caller waiting on retries is a caller
whose request is still open.
