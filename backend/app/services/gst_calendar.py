"""When a return for a period is due.

A monthly return's due date is arithmetic on the period, not a lookup: every
one of them falls on a fixed day of the *following* month, so the whole rule is
a day number plus a December rollover.

That is short enough that it had already been written twice — once in the
dashboard for GSTR-3B and once in supplier scoring for GSTR-1, each with its
own copy of the rollover — and the alerting needs both. Three copies of a rule
the government does move (the 3B date has been staggered by turnover before,
and quarterly filers under QRMP follow a different one entirely) is three
places to miss when it changes next, so it lives here once.

Only the returns *this business files* have a due date. A GSTR-2B is generated
by the portal rather than submitted to it, so asking when one is due is a
question about a return that is never late; :func:`due_date` refuses it rather
than inventing a day.

# straight to arithmetic that assumes a real month. ``next_period("2026-13")``
# is ``2026-14``, which ``date()`` refuses, so a due date computed from it was
# a 500 rather than the 422 a malformed query string has earned. The ones that
# did not raise were worse: ``2026-13`` built a GSTR-1 stamped ``fp=132026``
