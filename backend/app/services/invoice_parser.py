"""Turn an uploaded invoice into the structured fields GST filing needs.

Two extractors, tried in order:

1. **The model.** An OpenRouter free model reads the invoice text — or the
   image itself, via a free vision model — and returns JSON.
2. **Heuristics.** Regexes for the fields that have a fixed shape on an Indian
   tax invoice: the GSTIN (checksummed, so a hit is almost never a false one),
   the invoice number, the date, the tax amounts.

The heuristic pass is not only a fallback. It runs *after* a successful model
call too, to fill fields the model left blank and to overrule a GSTIN it
hallucinated — a 15-character string either passes the mod-36 check digit or
it does not, and that is a stronger signal than the model's confidence. What
comes back is a :class:`ParsedInvoice` with a confidence the caller can route
on, never an exception: a free-tier rate limit must not lose someone's invoice.

# read a line at a time (see :func:`_tax_amounts_on_line`), and a head's label
# turns up in plenty of prose that carries no tax at all: the rule 46 footer
# "IGST is not applicable on intra-state supply as per Section 8", or the page
# footer "Page 1 of 2 - CGST/SGST summary continued on 22/09/2024". Matched with
# :data:`_NUMBER_PATTERN`, those lines are read as tax lines and the last number
# on them becomes the head's amount — the section number, or a fragment of a
# date. That footer put ₹2 of CGST and ₹2,024 of SGST on the invoice.
#
# And it is not merely noise, because the first reading of a head wins: the
# figures above are set before the real ``CGST @ 9% 9,000.00`` two lines down is
# ever reached, so the true amount is discarded in favour of the page number.
# Tax on the invoice read 2,026.00 instead of 18,000.00, on a document that
# parses perfectly otherwise.
#
# Requiring the shape rather than the position is what makes the distinction
# survive layouts this module has not seen: a date, a section number, a page
# count and a serial are all bare integers, and none of them can be mistaken for
# ₹9,000.00. The cost is an invoice printing a whole-rupee amount with neither
# separator nor decimals — "IGST 18000" — whose tax now reads empty rather than
# wrong, which is the trade this module makes everywhere else and the one
# ``validate_period`` reports as figures that do not foot.

# written with dots is money-shaped for as long as the pattern looks at it:
# ``22.09.2024`` offers ``22.09`` — two digits, a point, two more — and nothing
# about those five characters says they are a day and a month. The pattern stops
# there because a third group is not part of any amount, so the figure it hands
# back is the front of the date with the year left behind.
#
# That is the same failure the shape test was added to close, reached by the

# ``IGST @ 18% 81,000.00`` below it was then discarded — an invoice whose tax was

# one, "INV-001" standing alone in the text no longer parses as the number
# "001" — it does not parse, and an empty field with a warning on it is a
# reviewable state in a way that a plausible wrong number is not.
#
# That same token is what makes a *one-character* number safe, and the two
# branches below differ only in whether they allow one. "Invoice No: 7" is how
# a business in its first month of trading prints an invoice, and a single
# minimum length of two characters dropped the number from every one of them —
# silently, because there is nothing to see afterwards. A missing invoice
# number is not a cosmetic loss: it files into GSTR-1 as ``inum: ""``, which
# the portal rejects; it is what reconciliation matches a GSTR-2B row on; and
# it is half the natural key duplicate detection uses. All three fail
# separately.
#
# The bare-separator branch keeps the two-character floor, because there the
# label was never confirmed and a single stray character after a full stop is
# noise rather than a document number.
#
# Every gap in the pattern is horizontal space, so the label, its separator and
# the value stay on one line. Written with a plain ``\s`` the separator run
# crossed the line break and took the first word of the *next* line as the
# number, which is how a document that prints its label with no value beside it
# — a column heading, or a wrapped line — came out with an invoice number of
# "Date", "Bill", "Total" or "of":
#
#     Invoice No.                 ->  "Date"
#     Date: 02/05/2026
#
#     TAX INVOICE                 ->  "of"
#     No. of Packages: 12
#
# Both are the silently-wrong number this pattern exists to prevent, and worse
# than the reading it was written to stop, because "of" is not even a document
# number: it files into GSTR-1 as ``inum``, it is what reconciliation matches a
# GSTR-2B row on, and it is half the key duplicate detection uses.
#
# The cost of the restriction is a layout that prints the heading and the value
# on separate rows, which now reads no number at all. That layout was never read
# correctly anyway — a header row carries the *next* label, not the value, so
# "Invoice No.  Invoice Date" over "MH/2026/118  02/05/2026" returned the word

# missing number, because the value is not merely wrong but is a real invoice
# number belonging to a real earlier document: reconciliation matches it against

# already filed under it, and GSTR-1 files two different supplies under one
# ``inum``. Nothing in that chain has any reason to look twice.

# So an explicit invoice-date label wins wherever the document carries one, and

# of the labels here, and "Original Invoice Date" in another.

# taxable against ₹18,000 of tax and filed at the wrong invoice value, with no
# warning on the review screen to say a figure had been read from the wrong

#
# "Assessable Value" is customs' own name for the figure duty is charged on —
# rule 3 of the Customs Valuation Rules uses it, so an import invoice, or one
# from a supplier whose template also handles imports, prints this rather than
# "Taxable Value". Left out, the field was not merely misread: a document
# whose IGST read correctly (:data:`_TAX_LABELS` matches "IGST" on its own
# line regardless of what the taxable line said) stored ₹0 taxable value
# beside a real tax figure, which is the shape ``validate_period``'s footing
# check exists to catch and cannot here — that check only runs when *both*

# A bare "Total" needs a guard the others do not. Unlike "Grand Total" or

# Discount" and "Sub-Total" — and unlike those two, "Sub-Total" is a real label
# read by :data:`_TAXABLE_PATTERN` above with a *different* figure. Matched
# without a guard, "Total" inside "Sub-Total: 200000.00" is exactly as valid a

# the actual "Amount Payable: 236000.00" a few lines down — replacing the
# grand total with the taxable value it was computed from, on a layout that
# otherwise parses every other field correctly.
#
# Anchoring to the start of a line closes that without a lookbehind for every
# spelling of "sub" (which Python's fixed-width lookbehind cannot express as
# one alternative anyway): a real total label is always the first word on its
# line, and "Sub-Total" is not — "Total" there is the second half of a
# hyphenated word, never the first token after a line break. The other three
# guards this module leans on for a bare word — "Total Tax", "Total Discount",
# "Total Quantity" — need no anchor at all, because the shared amount suffix
# below already requires a separator or a currency mark immediately after the

    ``_AMOUNT`` spells a well-formed figure and stops at the first character
    that is not part of one — but stopping is not the same as failing, and what
    it hands back is a *prefix* rather than nothing. That is the same shape of
    bug as :data:`_EXPONENT_SUFFIX`, reached from the other side: there the
    mantissa of a number too wide to spell, here the front of a figure whose
    middle the page could not spell either.

    OCR is what produces them, constantly and in two ways. It reads a zero as
    the letter O — ``1,OOO.00`` — and the pattern takes ``1,`` and leaves the
    rest; and it reads a thousands comma as a space — ``1 000.00`` — and the
    pattern takes ``1``. Both then pass :func:`to_money`, which is asked
    whether the digits in hand are an amount and not whether they are the
    *whole* amount, so a ₹1,000 invoice stores one rupee.

    A tax head misread this way is at least survivable, because
    :func:`validate` foots the total against taxable value plus tax and says so
    when they disagree. These two fields are the ones that check is made *of*,
    and it only runs when both are non-zero — so a document printing a grand
    total and no taxable line, which is most receipts, stored ₹1 with no
    warning raised and no confidence lost. Nothing anywhere downstream
    re-derives it, and every screen then shows one rupee.

    So a figure is refused unless it was read whole. It counts as whole if it
    carries paise; failing that, it must not end mid-grouping on a comma, must
    not run straight into a letter or digit that the pattern could not take,
    and — when it has neither comma nor point to show it was ever grouped —
    must not be followed by a space and the rest of its own grouping.

# "Whether the tax is payable on reverse charge basis" is required on the face

# false yes moves the tax into GSTR-3B table 3.1(d) as a liability that must be
# settled in cash, takes the invoice's credit out of the pool, and on a *sale*
# prints ``rchrg: "Y"`` into the customer's GSTR-2B, telling them they owe tax
# the supplier has already charged. A false no leaves a real liability
# undeclared, with interest running from the due date.
#
# The label and the answer are therefore matched as separate things, because
# the words overlap. "Applicable" is an answer in "Reverse Charge: Applicable"
# and part of the *label* in "Reverse Charge Applicable: No" — and the previous
# pattern, which made the label word optional and then looked for an
# affirmative, could not tell them apart. Failing to match "No", it simply
# backtracked, gave the optional group up, and matched the label's own
# "Applicable" as the answer. So "Reverse Charge Applicable: No" — one of the
# commonest ways an Indian invoice prints this, along with "Whether Reverse
# Charge Applicable: No" — came back flagged reverse charge, which is precisely
# the reading :func:`to_flag` was written to stop and which survived here
# because the answer never reached it.
#
# The label parts are matched possessively, so they cannot be given back to be
# re-read as the answer. A label with no answer after it therefore matches
# nothing at all, which is the right outcome: an unanswered heading is not a
# declaration, and the whole module prefers an empty field a reviewer can see
# to a plausible wrong one.
#
# The answer itself is whatever word follows, negatives included, and
# :func:`to_flag` decides what it means — the same vocabulary that reads the
# model's answer and the portal's flags, rather than a third opinion here. That
# also picks up the affirmatives the old pattern could not reach: "Reverse
# Charge (Y/N): Y" required a separator it had no room for, so an invoice that
# genuinely was reverse charge read as one that was not.
#
# "RCM" is the other half of the vocabulary. It is not a rare abbreviation of
# the phrase — on a large share of invoices it is the *only* wording printed,
# because the label has to fit a box on a pre-printed form: "Tax payable under
# RCM: Yes", "RCM Applicable: No", "Whether tax is payable under RCM (Y/N): Y".
# None of those contain the words "reverse charge", so none of them matched, and
# every one of them came back ``False`` — the field's default, indistinguishable
# from an invoice that says the answer is no.
#
# A missed "yes" is the same error :func:`to_flag` exists to prevent, taken from
# the other side, and it costs more than the false positive does. Reverse charge
# means the recipient pays the tax, so an invoice wrongly read as ordinary is
# marked creditable — see :meth:`app.models.invoice.Invoice.creditable`, which
# is ``itc_eligible and not reverse_charge`` — and the business claims credit for
# tax it never paid and still owes. On a sale the same miss prints ``rchrg: "N"``
# into GSTR-1, telling the customer's GSTR-2B they need not account for it, so
# the liability is dropped by both parties at once.
#
# The answer is still required, so the acronym cannot fire on its own. That is
# what keeps a supplier with "RCM" in its trade name from flagging every invoice
# it issues: the word after it is the rest of the name, which is not an answer,
# and a label with no answer matches nothing here by design.
#
# The two spellings also appear together, because a form that has room for the
# phrase still glosses it: "Whether GST is payable under reverse charge (RCM):
# Yes". The bracket there sits exactly where the "(Y/N)" box does, so it is
# admitted in the same place — without it the label ends at "charge", the ")"
# is not a separator, and the answer standing right beside it is not read.
#
# "Mechanism" is the third spelling, and the commonest of the three on a form
# that spells anything out at all — it is the statutory name in sections 9(3)
# and 9(4), so "Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) Applicable: Yes" is at least as
# ordinary as the bare "Reverse Charge" this pattern was written against. Left
# out, the word sat between "charge" and everything after it — the bracket,
# the label words, the separator — so none of those matched what followed and
# the line matched nothing at all. That is the failure the acronym clause
# above already describes from the other direction: a real "Yes" went unread
# and the field kept its default of "no reverse charge", marking the invoice
# creditable and, on a sale, telling the buyer's GSTR-2B they owe nothing.

    A column with no number beyond it falls back to the whole line, because

    on one line and only their order tells them apart. What that missed is that
    a line can name *two* heads, and the two ways it does are opposites.

    A line may lay the heads out side by side — ``CGST 9% 9,000.00  SGST 9%
    9,000.00`` — where each head has its own figure and both should be read.
    Reading each head from its own column is what makes that work; taking the
    last number on the line for both is right only by the accident that CGST
    and SGST are always equal.

    Or a line may *combine* them: ``Total Tax (CGST + SGST): 18,000.00``, the
    ordinary way an invoice summarises an intra-state supply. There is one
    figure and it is the total of both heads. Read per label, that ₹18,000
    became ₹18,000 of CGST *and* ₹18,000 of SGST — the tax on the invoice
    doubled, silently, at the moment of extraction.

    Doubled tax is not a display problem in either direction. On a purchase it
    doubles the credit claimed, which is over-claimed ITC with interest and a
    penalty on it. On a sale it doubles the output tax the business is told to
    pay. And it survives review, because every screen shows the same doubled
    figure and the arithmetic on the invoice is not re-derived anywhere a

    The two are told apart by counting: as many figures as heads means a figure

    single head. A combined line is therefore left unread rather than split —
    the split would be a guess, and this module prefers an empty field a
