"""Raising the deadline alerts the alerts table was built for.

``app/models/alert.py`` has described filing-deadline alerts, with delivery
state on the row, since the first migration — and until now nothing wrote one.
The dashboard has been counting them the whole time, which means it has been
reporting zero to every business on every load: not "you are up to date" but
"nothing here has an opinion", rendered identically.

This is the sweep that gives it an opinion. It runs once a day, reads where each
return stands, and keeps one alert per period and return type in step with it.

**Why a sweep rather than an event.** A deadline is not something that happens;
it is something that fails to happen. There is no request to hang the alert off
— the business simply does not file — so the only thing that can notice is a
clock. That is also why this is idempotent rather than incremental: the day's
truth is recomputed from the returns table each morning, so a sweep that was
skipped, ran twice, or ran on a box whose clock had drifted converges the next
morning regardless.

**What decides whether someone is told.** Three rules, all of them about not
becoming noise, because the product only gets one chance at this — a business
that is nagged about returns it has already filed turns notifications off once,
permanently, and is then not told about the one that matters.

1. *Nothing before the business existed.* A period that closed before signup is
   one this application holds no invoices for and cannot know the filing status
   of. Asserting that it is late is a guess, and six confident, wrong alerts on
   day one is the fastest way to lose the channel.
2. *Nothing until the deadline is near.* An alert three weeks out is not news;
   it is furniture. The first one lands :data:`LEAD_DAYS` before the due date.
3. *A dismissal is respected.* Closing an alert means "I know". The sweep will
   not raise a second copy tomorrow. It reopens one only when the severity
   genuinely changes — the deadline moving from approaching to missed is new
   information, and it can happen at most twice per return.

**What this does not do.** It does not send anything. The alert row is created
and the business sees it in the product; nothing here reaches email, SMS or
WhatsApp, and ``channel`` and ``sent_at`` stay null to say so. The feature doc
promises those channels and no infrastructure for any of them exists yet, so
what ships is the half that is real: the alert is raised, correctly and on time,
and whoever adds a sender has a durable row to send and to mark.
