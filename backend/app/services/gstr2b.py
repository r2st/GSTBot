"""Reading a GSTR-2B into something reconcilable.

GSTR-2B is the static ITC statement the portal generates for a buyer on the
14th of each month. It is the authoritative answer to "what have my suppliers
actually declared about me", and it is the right-hand side of every match this
product makes.

Two shapes arrive in practice and both are supported:

* **The portal JSON.** Downloaded from Returns > GSTR-2B > Download. The real
  envelope is ``{"data": {"docdata": {"b2b": [...]}}}``, with a supplier-level
  wrapper (``ctin``, ``trdnm``, ``supfildt``) holding a list of invoices, each
  holding a list of rate-wise ``items``. Abbreviated keys throughout.
* **The CSV/Excel export.** One flat row per rate line, with human column
  headings. Businesses forward this far more often than the JSON because it is
  what opens in Excel.

Everything is flattened to one :class:`GSTR2BRecord` per *invoice* — rate-wise
items are summed — because an invoice is the unit a buyer books, disputes and
claims credit on. The rate breakdown is kept on the record for display.

Nothing here touches the database: this module turns bytes into records, and
:mod:`app.services.reconciliation` decides what they mean.

    is summed onto its invoice, and every invoice is summed into the period
    totals, so a hundred cells each just inside ``MONEY_MAX`` store a figure a
    hundred times wider than the column holds. Five rate items at the ceiling

    The failure is the split this product keeps meeting from the other side:
    Postgres refuses the INSERT with ``numeric field overflow`` and SQLite
    keeps whatever it was handed, so the deployment answers 500 on an import
    that the suite watches succeed. The import is also the wrong end to notice
    it at — the row is written and committed before any response model looks at
    the number.

    So it is checked here, before anything is stored, and the whole file is
    refused rather than the offending line dropped. A statement is a single
    document that has to add up: silently discarding one rate line would leave
    a stored 2B whose totals disagree with the portal's, which is worse than
    saying the file cannot be read — and no real statement is anywhere near
    ninety-nine thousand crore, so anything that gets here is corrupt or
    hand-edited rather than large.

    Magnitudes are summed, not signed amounts, so a credit note cannot net a
