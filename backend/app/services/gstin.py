"""GSTIN parsing, validation and the tax split that follows from it.

A GSTIN is 15 characters: ``27AAPFU0939F1ZV``.

===========  ==========================================================
Position     Meaning
===========  ==========================================================
1-2          State code (01-38, plus 97 "other territory" and 99 "centre")
3-12         PAN of the registered entity
13           Entity/registration number for that PAN in that state (1-9, A-Z)
14           Always ``Z`` (reserved by the GST design)
15           Check digit, base-36 weighted mod-36
===========  ==========================================================

The check digit matters more than it looks: a transposed character in a
supplier GSTIN is the single most common cause of a purchase invoice failing to
match anything in GSTR-2B, and it is silent — the invoice just shows up as
"missing at the supplier's end" and the ITC on it goes unclaimed. Validating at
ingest turns that into an error the user can fix while the paper is still in
their hand.
