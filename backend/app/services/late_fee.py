"""Late fee and interest on a return filed after its due date — ss.47 and 50.

Two different penalties, on two different bases, and conflating them is the
mistake this module exists to avoid:

* **Late fee** (s.47) is a flat per-day amount for filing *late*, regardless
  of what is owed. It runs from the day after the due date to the day the
  return is actually filed — or to today, projected, while it still sits
  unfiled — split evenly between CGST and SGST, and capped by a table the
  government has revised by notification more than once.
* **Interest** (s.50(1)) is 18% per annum, simple, on the tax actually *paid
  late* — the net cash liability, output tax less eligible ITC — and it has
  nothing to do with when the return was filed. A business that settles the
  cash ledger on the due date but files the return three days later owes a
  full late fee and no interest; one that files on time but pays a week later
  owes interest and no late fee. Only GSTR-3B carries interest, because it is
  the only return a cash payment is made through: GSTR-1 declares supplies
  and GSTR-2B is not even filed — see :mod:`app.services.gst_calendar` on why
  it has no due date at all.

Both are the ordinary-case flat rates. The notified relief rates for specific
past periods (the pandemic waivers of 2020-21, chiefly) are not modelled: which
of those applied turned on the filing date of a return that predates this
product, not on any figure it holds, and a period reconciled today still owes
the ordinary rate on the money it is short by.
