"""Sending one plain-text email over SMTP — the one delivery channel this
product implements.

``app/services/alerting.py`` raises alert rows and says outright that nothing
reaches email, SMS or WhatsApp yet. This is the email half of that promise:
``smtplib`` against whatever relay ``SMTP_HOST`` names, with no template engine
and no queue of its own — the queue is Celery beat, and the caller decides what
"one message" means.

Kept to the standard library on purpose. A transactional-email provider's SDK
would mean a second set of credentials and a second failure mode to model, for
a volume — one digest per business per day — that plain SMTP handles without
noticing.

A refusal that would go away by itself is retried here, for the same reason
``openrouter_client`` retries one: the alternative is a materially worse
outcome, not merely a later one. The digest carries filing deadlines, a failed
send leaves the rows ``FAILED`` rather than dropping them, and ``FAILED`` is
still sendable — so the recovery already in place is *tomorrow's* run. On an
alert about a return due tomorrow, a day late is not a degraded delivery. A
relay that dropped the connection, is still starting up, or answered 4xx
because it is rate-limiting or greylisting this sender will take the same
message on the second attempt, seconds later.

Only transient refusals, though. SMTP's reply codes run the opposite way round
to HTTP's, and getting that backwards is how a retry loop becomes an outage:
**4xx is the transient one** ("try again later"), 5xx is permanent ("no such
mailbox", "authentication failed"). Asking twice about a mailbox that does not
exist turns a clear failure into a slow one, and repeating a rejected login is
how a relay decides to lock the account.
