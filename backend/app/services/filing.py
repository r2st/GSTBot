"""Turning the books into something the GST portal will accept.

Three jobs, in the order a business does them:

1. **Validate.** Catch what the portal will reject, plus what it will silently
   accept and the department will query later. A rejected upload costs an
   afternoon; an accepted-but-wrong return costs interest and a notice, so both
   classes of problem are reported and the second is not treated as cosmetic.
2. **Generate.** Build GSTR-1 from sales invoices and pre-fill GSTR-3B from the
   matched position, in the portal's own JSON shape.
3. **Export.** JSON for the offline utility, CSV for a human to read or a CA to
   check before anything is filed.

The portal's schema is the contract and it changes on the government's
timetable, so the shapes here are built explicitly rather than derived from the
ORM: when the schema moves, the diff should land in this file and nowhere else.

Two conventions the portal uses and nothing else does:

* ``fp`` / ``ret_period`` is ``MMYYYY``. Not ``YYYY-MM``, which is what the
  rest of this codebase stores.
* Invoice dates are ``dd-mm-yyyy``.

    one that was never filed. That matters beyond bookkeeping: the deadline
    alerting reads exactly this, so a filing that is never recorded is a
    business that keeps being told it is late.

    Idempotent per period and return type. Re-recording corrects the ARN or the
    date rather than filing a second time, which matches the partial unique
    index on the table — and matches what the caller means, since there is only
    ever one live GSTR-1 for a period. An omitted ARN is "not to hand" and
    leaves a stored one intact; only a supplied one replaces it. An omitted
    date on a re-record is "unchanged" for the same reason: the documented
    flow is to mark the return filed on the day and add the ARN when the
    acknowledgement arrives, and defaulting that second call to today re-dated
    every on-time filing whose ARN came after the due date — which put a late
    fee on it, and had the alerting say it was late.

    ``data`` is the return as *this application builds it now*. Immediately
    after an export — which is the flow this exists for — that is exactly what
    went to the portal. Recorded months later, against books that have since
    been corrected, it is not, and it is stored as the best available record
    rather than as proof of what was submitted. The ARN is the proof.

    A re-record leaves that snapshot alone. The first recording is the closest
    thing to what the portal received, and the portal takes no revised return
    for a period — a sale booked after filing is declared as an amendment in a
    later month. Rebuilding the snapshot while adding the ARN rewrote the
    record to say that sale was in the filed return, and the totals shown
    beside the ARN stopped agreeing with the acknowledgement they sat next to.

    """Pre-fill GSTR-3B for *period* from sales, purchases and the last run.

    Table 4 is filled from the reconciled ITC position rather than from the
    purchase register, because 4(A) is credit *available* and only GSTR-2B
    establishes that. The reversals computed under Rules 37, 42 and 43 land in
    4(B), and 4(C) is the net — which is the figure that actually reduces the
    cash payable.

    Table 3.1 takes one line from the purchase side: 3.1(d), the inward
    supplies the buyer owes the tax on. It used to take none, and a business
    paying a goods transport agency, a lawyer or an unregistered landlord filed
    a 3B that declared no reverse-charge liability at all. That tax cannot be
    settled from the credit ledger — s.49(4) lets credit pay "output tax", and
    s.2(82) puts reverse charge outside it — so the omission is cash the
    business did not pay, with interest running on it from the due date. The
    credit it earns comes back at 4(A)(3), which is why the round trip is
    close to free over the month and the missing declaration was invisible.

    Rule 37 is a clock — credit reverses 180 days after an invoice date — and a
    clock has to be told which day the return is a statement about. Reading it
    off *today* made a closed period's return move: a business that generated
    its January 3B in February and again in March got two different documents,
    the second one reversing credit on invoices that had not yet crossed 180
    days when January ended, and on invoices dated months *after* January that
    could not belong to its return at all. Anchored to the close of the period,
    so re-generating an old return reproduces it.

    *as_of* overrides that anchor, for a caller reconstructing what the return
    would have said on some other day. The default is capped at today, so
    previewing a month still in progress does not reverse credit early.

    Anchoring the clock is only half of it: the reversal in 4(B) is what
    lapsed *during* this period, not everything standing at its close. Rule 37
    is paid once, in the return for the month the 180 days ran out, and
    re-availed when the supplier is paid. Taking the whole standing exposure
    reversed the same invoice again in every return that followed it — April,
    then May, then June — so a business filing four months gave back four
    times what the rule asks for, and each of those returns still reproduced
    itself exactly, which is what made it invisible.

    And the re-availment is the other half again. The reversal was declared and
    the credit never came back: paying the supplier merely stopped the reversal
    recurring, so an invoice that once crossed 180 days lost its whole ITC for
    good. It is claimed here in 4(A) — see :func:`app.services.itc.rule_37_reavailment`.

    """Build a return and validate its period, reading the sales side once.

    Both halves want the same rows. ``build_gstr1`` needs them to fill the
    B2B/B2CL/B2CS blocks, ``build_gstr3b`` to fill table 3.1 and 3.2, and
    ``validate_period`` to check every field on each of them — and each was
    calling :func:`_invoices` for itself, so a preview issued the identical
    query twice and hydrated the same period into two sets of ORM objects.

    That is not a rounding error at the sizes this endpoint is asked about. On
    a period of 3,000 sales invoices the two halves cost 80 ms each and the
    duplicated read is 33 ms of that — a fifth of the whole response, spent
    fetching rows already sitting in the session.

    Passing the list rather than caching inside :func:`_invoices` because a
    cache keyed on the session would have to guess when an upload or a
    reconciliation had invalidated it, and guessing wrong means a return built
    from stale invoices. Here the read and both uses of it are three lines
    apart, so the list cannot go stale between them.

    The validation is over sales in both cases. GSTR-3B is a summary with no
    invoice detail of its own, and what would stop it being filed is the same
    unreadable or malformed sales rows that would stop the GSTR-1.

    ``\\r\\n`` line endings and quoting on every non-numeric field: this is
    opened in Excel far more often than it is parsed, and Excel is where a
    stray comma in a trade name silently shifts a row.

    Being opened in Excel is also why every text column goes through
    :func:`~app.core.sanitize.csv_safe`. The fields here are free text off an
    uploaded invoice, and Excel runs a cell that starts with ``=``. The numeric
    columns are deliberately not put through it: this application formats them,
    and a credit note's leading ``-`` is a minus sign.

    ``total_value`` is derived by :func:`_invoice_value` rather than read off
    the column, for the reason that function exists: the stored total defaults
    to zero and is only filled when the parser found a grand-total *label* on
    the document, so an invoice whose total was printed as "Amount Payable"
    carries a stored zero. Read straight off the row, this column reported a
    real supply as one worth nothing — and reported it in the one artefact a CA
    opens to check a period before it is filed, while ``/filing/export/gstr1.json``
    for the same period carried the right figure all along. Two exports of one
    month disagreeing about what an invoice is worth is worse than either being
    wrong on its own, because the CSV is what gets believed.
