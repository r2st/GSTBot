"""Input Tax Credit: what may be claimed, what must be reversed, what it settles.

Three separate questions, deliberately kept apart because they are governed by
different parts of the Act and fail in different ways:

* **How much credit is available.** Reconciliation already answers this per
  invoice — credit is capped by what the supplier declared in GSTR-2B. This
  module only pools that answer by tax head.
* **How much must be given back.** Rules 37, 42 and 43 reverse credit that was
  legitimately taken at the time and stopped being available later: because the
  supplier was never paid, because the input fed an exempt supply, or because a
  capital good's credit belongs to sixty months rather than one.
* **How the credit settles the liability.** Sections 49, 49A and 49B fix the
  order in which credit is set off against output tax. The order is not a
  preference — using the wrong head first leaves a business paying cash it did
  not need to pay while credit expires in the ledger.

The set-off is the part worth reading twice. CGST and SGST credit may never
touch each other's liability: they are levied by different governments, and the
ledger keeps them apart no matter how convenient the offset would be. IGST is
the only credit that crosses, and it must be exhausted first.

Every figure is ``Decimal``. GST is computed to the paisa, and a float cannot
hold 18% of ₹1,234.56.

    reverse-charge purchase has no credit to reverse, and reporting one would
    send a business chasing a payment for no tax reason.

    "Unpaid" is judged as of *as_of*, not as of now. A payment made after the
    date being asked about had not happened yet on that date, and reading
    ``paid_at`` as a plain flag made a closed period's answer depend on what has

    anchors this to the close of the period precisely so that re-generating an

    deleted the reversal from January's 3B — a return that had already been
    filed with it, and whose stored copy ``record_filing`` rewrites every time
    the ARN is corrected. Under-reversed credit is over-claimed credit, and it
    carries interest.

    An invoice with no date is skipped rather than assumed overdue. The clock
    runs from the invoice date, and a missing date means the extraction failed,
    not that 180 days have passed.

    The 180 days are counted in Indian calendar days, because that is the

    Reverse charge is the one place a *purchase* creates a liability. On a
    freight bill from a goods transport agency, on a lawyer's fee, on rent from
    an unregistered landlord, the supplier charges nothing and the buyer pays
    the tax to the government directly. It is declared in GSTR-3B table 3.1(d),
    and it is not optional.

    Two things follow, and they pull in opposite directions:

    * **It must be paid in cash.** s.49(4) lets the credit ledger settle
      "output tax", and s.2(82) defines output tax to exclude tax payable on
      reverse charge. A ledger full of credit does not reduce this by a rupee,
      which is why it is kept out of :class:`SetOffResult` and reported beside
      it instead.
    * **It becomes credit.** Once paid it is input tax like any other, claimed
      in the same return at table 4(A)(3) — unless the input is one s.17(5)
      blocks, which is what ``itc_eligible`` records.

    So the cash effect of an ordinary reverse-charge purchase is close to nil
    over the month, and the *declaration* is the whole point: leaving 3.1(d)
    empty understates the liability, and interest runs on the shortfall from
    the due date whether or not the credit was there to cover it.
