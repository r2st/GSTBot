"""Authentication: register (with GSTIN onboarding), login, me.

The rate limits here are the strictest in the product and are keyed by
*address* rather than by identity, because the attack these endpoints face
comes from someone who has no identity yet: credential stuffing against login,
bulk sign-ups against register. Everywhere else, limiting by IP would punish an
office behind one NAT; here it is the only key that means anything.

Login carries a second limit on top, keyed by the account being attempted.
An address limit alone is only as strong as the number of addresses the
attacker has, and a stuffing run's whole shape is one guess per host across
thousands of hosts — twenty a minute each, against one account, is a password
every three seconds from a limiter that never sees the same key twice. The
per-account counter is the one that costs the attacker something, because the
target is the thing they cannot spread the load across.
