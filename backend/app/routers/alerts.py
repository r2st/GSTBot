"""Reading the alerts the sweep raises, and closing the ones you have handled.

The daily sweep in ``app/services/alerting.py`` writes rows and the dashboard
counts them. Until this router there was nothing in between: no way to read what
an alert said, and — more to the point — no way to dismiss one. The sweep's
central rule is that a dismissal is respected and never raised again, and that
rule could not fire, because no caller could produce a dismissal.

**Two verbs, not a status field.** ``PATCH {"status": ...}`` would be the shorter
API and the wrong one. Of the six statuses only two belong to the business —
read it, or close it. PENDING, SENT and FAILED are delivery state that a future
sender owns, and RESOLVED means the return was actually filed. A client that
could write RESOLVED would destroy the one measurement the enum split exists
for: whether these alerts cause anybody to do anything.
