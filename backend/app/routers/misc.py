"""Health and metadata routes — no auth, no database writes.

Three health endpoints rather than one, because an orchestrator asks three
different questions and answering them all with the same check is how a
transient database blip turns into every pod being killed at once:

* ``/health/live`` — is the process alive? Never touches a dependency.
* ``/health/ready`` — should traffic be routed here? Fails on a dead database,
  because an instance that cannot read invoices should leave the rotation.
* ``/health`` — the operator's view: every dependency, with its latency, and a
  ``health`` field that distinguishes "degraded" from "down". "Every" includes
  the upload volume — a disk is a dependency that fails, and it used to be
  probed once at boot and never again.

``/health`` returns 200 while degraded, on purpose. The product still ingests
invoices without a model provider (heuristics take over) and without Redis
(parsing runs inline), so a monitor has to be able to tell "AI is down" from
"the API is down" — and a 503 for the former would page someone at 3am over a
free-tier rate limit.
