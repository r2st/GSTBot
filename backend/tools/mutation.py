"""A small, targeted mutation tester.

Line coverage says a line *ran*. It does not say that anything would have
noticed if the line were wrong. At 99% coverage that distinction is the only
one left worth measuring: a suite can execute every branch of the GSTIN check
digit and still pass if the modulus changes, and the way to find out is to
change the modulus and see whether anything goes red.

So: parse a module, enumerate every place a plausible one-character bug could
live, and for each one produce that module with exactly that bug in it and run
the tests that are supposed to cover it. A mutant the suite fails on is
*killed*. A mutant it still passes is *survived*, and a survivor is either a
missing assertion or — occasionally, and this is why it is worth running — a
line whose behaviour nobody has actually decided on.

Why not mutmut: the operator set here is deliberately small and the test
selection is explicit rather than coverage-derived, which is what makes a run
take a minute instead of an evening. Each target names the test files that are
supposed to cover it, and that mapping is itself an assertion — if a survivor
turns out to be killed by some other file's tests, the target was wrong about
where its coverage comes from.

Usage::

    python -m tools.mutation --target gstin
    python -m tools.mutation --all --jobs 8
    python -m tools.mutation --module app/core/sanitize.py --tests tests/test_sanitize.py

Nothing here imports the application, and the mutated copy is written into a
temporary tree rather than over the working copy — an interrupted run cannot
leave a mutant behind in the repo.

# A target's test list is a claim about where a module's coverage comes from,
# and until now nothing checked it. It was wrong for five of the fourteen: the
# GSTR-1 section assembly in `filing` is only ever run by writing a return and
# reading it back, which `test_filing.py` does not do, so a seventh of that
# module was mutated against tests that never called it. Every mutant there
# survived, and the score read 68.8% — as if the assertions were missing, when
# in fact the caller was.
#
# A line the listed tests never execute can only produce survivors, so the
# cheap check is coverage, not mutation: one pytest run per target instead of
# one per mutant. It is on demand rather than in CI for the same reason the
# mutation run is — it costs a suite run per target — but it is what these
# lists are maintained with.
